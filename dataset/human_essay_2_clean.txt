In many literary works there is a central conict. Conict can occur in many ways. There is character versus another character, character versus an out- side force like nature, and internal conict, where a character must battle themselves mentally and emotionally. Often these types of conicts can occur simultaneously in a literary work. I have chosen to discuss my favorite type of conict in one of my favorite plays by Shakespeare; Hamlet.Internal conict is the most intricate of all the types of conict. We may read about a character that must physically defend themselves against another character. Also, there are many characters that have to brave the elements and survive in life-threatening situations. For example, Ishmael, the narrator and sole survivor in Herman Melville's Moby Dick tells the story of the giant white whale. But the most intense is internal conict. In Shake- speare's Hamlet, a young prince must battle his conscience.Hamlet, the main character, has recently lost his father. While he is still mourning, his mother marries his father's brother, Claudius. However, Hamlet's father's ghost appears to him and shows him the foul play that sur- rounded his death. Hamlet learns that his uncle actually murdered his father! This is where internal conict is most present. In one of the most famous Shakespearian lines, Hamlet ponders, "To be, or not to be . . . ". Hamlet must now decide whether to take action and avenge his father's death, or to remain passive. This decision weighs so heavily on his conscience, that oth- ers notice a drastic change in his behavior. Hamlet must decide if being pas- sive is the equivalent of being a coward. Eventually, this play comes to a tragic end, and Hamlet decides to avenge his father's murder.I believe that internal conict works ideally in literature. Of course, Shakespeare presents Hamlet's internal conict through soliloquy, and this was performed on stage, but when you are able to read what a person is struggling through, you can more closely relate to the character. Internal158  conict conjures up the fears that many of us have in everyday life. Hope- fully ours are not as tragic as Hamlets were!
Conict is what makes literature interesting to read. If there were no prob- lems, then the reader might become bored. One type of conict is called internal conict. This type occurs when a character is battling their con- science. One such character that experiences this is Hamlet from one of Shakespeare's most famous plays.In Hamlet, the main character (by the same name), has just lost his father in a war. His father was the king of Denmark, and Hamlet is prince. Ham- let is visited by his father's ghost and shown that his death was murder by Hamlet's own uncle! This puts Hamlet in a really bad spot. Now he must decide whether to seek revenge for his father's death or do nothing. Why would he do nothing? Well, his uncle is marrying his mother now. Hamlet has the toughest time trying to decide whether seek revenge. The famous quote "To be or not to be . . ." shows his internal conict.Hamlet does seek revenge, but I like how Shakespeare shows what a character is thinking and what goes on in their minds. Internal conict adds interest for audiences.
In this essay I will talk about what is internal conict. In many works of writers, a person has thoughts that lead them to make choices. You can tell what that person is thinking by reading. Hamlet had one where he did not like his uncle and his dad was ded. Hamlet had to get even with his dads killers or do nothing. So Hamlet had a hard time trying to make up his mind.I think that internal conict is when you have a problem that needs to have solved.159

Hester Prynne, from Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, would not necessarily have fared much better today than in her own time. Some of the Puritanical inuences in Salem, Massachusetts at that time still exist in modern society. Public ridicule remains an integral part of our culture, in- delity is still deplored, and unfortunately, women are still often seen as the more guilty party of any extramarital affair.In The Scarlet Letter, Reverend Dimmsdale is a spiritual leader of the community. However, he impregnates a young woman named Hester Prynne, who believes her husband has died at sea. As a result of their affair, Hester is forced to wear a scarlet "A" on her chest and stand in the midst of the town on a scaffold. Meanwhile, Dimmsdale keeps his distance and remains silent out of fear. In modern times, it would be hard to imagine anyone who has had an affair being forced to wear a red letter on his or her clothes for all to see, but, at the same time, public ridicule has become a part of modern culture as well. Celebrities are publically ridiculed on the cov- ers of tabloid magazines every day, and the details of their private lives are frequently broadcast on shows like Access Hollywood. In our society, extra- marital affairs have become public knowledge. From celebrities to politi- cians, one way or another, affairs make news and sell papers.167  Also, in the book, Hester Prynne is unfairly singled out as the guilty one as a result of Dimmesdale's silence. Even now, it is often the woman who is viewed as the immoral one with poor judgment. Although Dimmesdale nally delivers a powerful sermon toward the end of the novel, confessing to the affair before his congregation, he dies-rather conveniently-shortly after, thereby escaping any punishment or public ridicule. So, in the end, Hester Prynne may not have been treated much better in our times. For its portrayal of this timeless situation, The Scarlet Letter remains a viable novel.
Our society views women the same as in Nathaniel Hawthorne's Scarlet Let- ter. It's very interesting how things change very little in such a wide span of time. Hester Prynne is brought in front of the town on a scaffold for having an affair and becoming pregnant. Her husband is assumed lost at sea, however the townspeople scorn her and exclude her from society. She is made to wear a letter A on her clothes for embarrassment. Although sometimes women who have affairs are treated badly, they don't ever have to wear scarlet letters any- more.Reverend Dimmsdale is never really looked at badly, even though at the end he confesses. It's the same today. Usually, there is one person who is viewed as the bad guy, and one person who is innocent, even though both people are having the affair. It's the same sort of thing you read in the news- papers with celebrities and politicians, it seems someone is always having an affair. For all these reasons, I think that what happens in the book is mostly the same as what would happen in modern times.
Hester in the scarlet letter was a women who had had an afair with an importent man and she was made fun because of it. She had to where an A letter to show she was sorry. Everyne in the town didnt like her becase they think she did something very bad and they also were not mean to the man. I wouldnt treet poeple like that along time ago today or in the futur either.

You might think a memorable picture would have vivid color, an appealing or inspirational theme, or be something you might want to display and look at every day. That is not the case with the picture that is most memorable to me. This picture is really a large mural, painted in 1937 by the Spanish artist, Pablo Picasso, to protest the bombing of a small village in northern Spain.Surprisingly, there is no vivid red color to show the owing blood. One must imagine this, for the mural is startlingly gray, black, and white. But there is no avoiding the horror of the images. The gures are not realisti- cally drawn, but are cubist and abstract, and it is apparent that innocent civilians are being slaughtered. A mother screams with her mouth wide open, her head tipped back in heart-rending anguish, as she holds her dead baby. A soldier lies dead on the ground, clutching his broken sword, and three other people are shown in shock and agony. Animals, including a tor- tured horse and a crying bird, are also portrayed as innocent victims of a massacre. Some symbols are open to interpretation. What is the meaning of the bull, which seems simply to be observing, or of the light bulb emit- ting rays at the top of the mural? Does the bull symbolize brute force, and83  does the light bulb signify that there is hope? Yet there is no doubt that the distorted, horrible images are intended to shock the viewer. This depiction of human grief is a profound statement of the cruelty and senselessness of war. Limiting the pictures to black and white adds a funereal element to the shocking depiction of the catastrophe.The memory of the picture cannot be forgotten; it is a metaphor for the senselessness and the horror of war. While it was painted to protest atroc- ities in a long ago war, it is as relevant today as the recollection of the hor- rors of September 11th. Perhaps it should be shown to all those who contemplate starting a war. Would it be worth it to have another Guernica?
The picture I remember is Guernica. It is by Picasso. It is not realist. The shapes don't look real but you know what they are in real life. It is in black and white. It is not in color like most pictures. But it really gets to you. It shows people getting killed or already killed. A baby is killed and a soldier is killed. The mother is screaming because her baby is dead. You won't for- get that.What this picture does is to make you know that war kills people and it is just awful. It kills people and it kills animals and even if you are not killed you will probly be screaming or crying. This picture could be for any war it doesn't matter. You remember it because it makes you upset and you wish there would never be a war. Then people wouldn't have to suffer. This pic- ture is memorable because you remember how the people suffered and they probly didn't do anything.
I remember a picture that is very big. It is Guernica. It is about people dieing and screaming and horses. I don't like it it dosent make sens. Who cared about a horse and why is it in black and white. I don't like black and white movies or pithcers. My sister had black and whites at her wedding and of cours I hated it. But I do remember it because everyone is yelling.

I must have had a guardian angel that day.I was six and had just learned how to ride a bicycle. My bike was a beauty: pink all over, with a stylish banana seat, iridescent fringes hanging off the handle bars, and a white woven basket with big, pink owers on the front. It was a Monday afternoon and I was alone, riding my bike in circles in the driveway. I was exalting in my freedom: no more training wheels, no more big brother or father pushing me from behind and holding me steady.Now I could start, stop, and ride all by myself, and I went around and around our circular driveway in complete bliss.The sun shone on my face and made the black pavement hot, even though it was already late September. Emboldened by the warmth of the sun and the excitement of my success-eight laps around and I hadn't fallen yet-I decided it was time to leave the safety of the circle and ride down the steep hill that led to the road on which we lived: Route 309, a four-lane, heavily-traveled highway. I warmed up with another two or three turns around the circle and then eased to my right and down the slope.From the start of the circle to the edge of the highway, the driveway ran about 200 feet at an even 45 degrees. I began to pick up a lot of speed at 50 feet, more at 75, and by 100 feet I was ying. The road was getting closer; I could see the faces of the people driving by at 50, 60, 70 miles an hour. It was time to slow down, but I couldn't. I kept going faster, and faster, and I couldn't stop. In my panic, I forgot how to use the brakes.In an instant I was out on the highway, a little pink streak that zoomed across all four lanes and somehow, someway, ended up on the other side, up on the Zeigler's lawn, in one piece. In the seconds that it took me to cross the road, there had not been a single car. An instant later, they were back, and I had to wait several minutes before I slowly, shakily, walked my bike back across the street and up the driveway.I never told anyone about what happened, and it was a long, long time before I ventured down that slope again. When I did, I used my brakes the whole way down. This time, I wasn't going to forget.127  
I once had a brush with disaster and nearly got myself killed. I was six and just learned how to ride my bike by myself. I loved my bike. It was pink and had a banana seat and a basket in front.On the day that this happened, I was riding around in our driveway. Our driveway was a long hill and then a big circle at the top. I was riding around in the circle.It was the rst time I was all alone on my bike. After a while because I didn't fall at all, I decided to go down the hill. I start down the slope and I realize I can't remember how to break. This of course is a problem because I start going faster and faster, any minute I will be out on the highway.We lived on Route 309, a 4-lane highway that was always busy with cars. Suddenly I was zooming across that road. Somehow, I made it across all four lanes without getting hit by a car.I don't know how I was so lucky, to not be hurt at all that day. Because a minute later, as soon as I was across, there were more cars on the road than I could count. Somehow, when I was going across, there just weren't any cars. Maybe I had a guardian angel watching over me.
When I have just learned to ride a bike, I almost have a big accident. That almost gets me killed. My favorite bike, I'm riding it around and around in the driveway. I like this bike so much. My aunt, she gived it to me as a pres- ent. For my birthday.All of a suddenly I am starting going down the hill, I forgot how to stop, I am going across the road. There are four lanes and lots of cars. Somehow I don't get hit by nothing. I walk my bike back up the hill. I am thinking never to tell anyone. Boy I am so lucky!

Who could have predicted twenty years ago that communication would change as radically as it has? Today, communication is instantaneous. No longer do we have to use a pen, pencil, or typewriter to write a letter. No longer do we have to use a postal service to mail it. No longer do we have to wait for a response that takes several days. Nor do we have to stay near a telephone or search for a public phone while traveling. Things have speeded up exponentially.In the last twenty years we have beneted from tremendous changes in telecommunication. The relatively simple change to portable phones enabled us to roam around the house while chatting, not limited by the length of the cord that attaches the receiver to the base of the telephone. Then came the beeper, allowing us to get a message when away from a tele- phone. Now, of course, there is the ubiquitous cell phone. Watch the crowds walking along a sidewalk, and you can't help noticing people pur- posefully striding along while talking on their cell phones.What if we must write a message? We now have e-mail. We send these messages immediately after typing them on the computer keyboard and never have to go to the Post Ofce. No more "snail mail." Perhaps we have71  a written copy that must be sent but cannot be conveniently sent via the computer. Simply dial a phone number, push a few buttons, send a FAX. The copy is transmitted to the receiver at once. The ability to telecommute is almost like handing the copy to the recipient. What a difference twenty years has made. Just as most of us could not imagine the speed and ease of communication in the twenty-rst century, we probably cannot anticipate the changes that will occur in the next twenty years. Perhaps we will be able to send instant messages simply by thinking about them, from one brain to the brain of the intended recipient.
I believe communication has denitly changed in the last 20 years. It is much different. I can send e-mails to my friends every day. Even twice a day if I want. I could not do this a few years ago. It's great. So I think commu- nication is much faster and I denitly think it is much easier if you have a computer. Every school and ofce has a computer.I believe the best change is the cell phone. I have a cell phone that I carry everywhere I go. I can turn it off in the movie and it will vibrate (shake). Then I know I have a call and I can leave and answer it. I don't think it is right for you to bother someone with your cell phone.I don't even need stamps to send cards. I can send them on the computer. All my friends have e-mail. And if they don't they don't get a card untill they do.I can also send a FAX on the telephone if I have to send a copy right then. These are the ways communication has changed in the last 20 years.
Communication is talking. In some ways it has changed in the last 20 years. I think I can talk easily now because I cary around with my phone. It is pink and everyone likes it. Because I worked to earn it each month. You don't have to read the paper you can watch tv if you want. Tv tells you about clothes and stuff that you care about. So communication is grate. Commu- nication is also the computer which is all over. I hate to rite so I use my cell but I could if I felt like it. My mother uses it. So she says it is much better.72

In today's world, the rst place people turn to when there is a question to be answered, information to be located, or people to be contacted, is often the Internet. Yes, the Internet may have supplanted the traditional ency- clopedia as well as a number of other sources of service and information. We can make reservations, plan vacations, play interactive games, learn a language, listen to music or radio programs, read the newspaper, and nd out about a medical condition, without coming face to face with another person. There is no limit to the subject matter you can research on the Internet. Just go to a search engine such as Yahoo or Google, type in a few key words or a Web address, and presto, you will probably summon links to more sources than you could have imagined. The Internet allows you to remain at your computer and shop no matter what you wish to purchase. And if you are looking for a bargain or an unusual item, you can go to a popular auction site and either sell or buy.If, however, you do wish to speak directly to a person, there are the chat rooms. On practically any given topic, groups of people converse with each other. They may be giving opinions about a perfect travel itinerary, a book, or even a political party. The most prevalent use of the Internet also involves directly writing to a person, and that is the sending of e-mail mes- sages to friends and associates. It is possible to communicate instantly with anyone, anywhere, as long as there is an Internet connection. In a world where people frequently travel, where families do not necessarily live in the same neighborhoods, e-mail is a means of making simple, inexpensive, immediate contact. Not only do we send verbal messages, but also now digital cameras take pictures that can be stored and then instantly trans- mitted on the Internet.64  Unfortunately, there are individuals who subvert the opportunities offered by this technology. They are less than honest, disguise their iden- tity, bilk people in nancial scams, and entice unsuspecting people, includ- ing children, into giving them personal information. Caveats about these problems are currently being publicized so those Internet users will not be victimized.Of course, the Internet providers, such as AOL, hope to make a prot, and there is usually a monthly fee for the hookup. To increase the prots, the providers sell advertising, which may pop up on the subscriber's screen and require the user to stop and respond, either positively or negatively, to the ads. When you consider that, among other things, you can hear a concert, read a book, visit a museum and view its contents, visit the websites of numerous individuals and organizations, play a game with one or more peo- ple, and pay your bills, you will realize that the uses of the Internet are too vast for a short list. Most would agree that much has been added to peoples' lives by connecting them to the Internet, and that we probably cannot antic-ipate what new purposes will be explored in the future.
The internet is very useful. You can send e-mail to your friends. They can write back to you. You can do this whenever you want. You can write to peo- ple you don't know. You can meet people through the internet. When someone goes to college you can write to them every day.You can look things up. If you want to nd out about something you can look it up. You don't have to go to the library. If you have to read a book you can nd out about it and not read it. There are good games you can put in your computer. I like these games. I want to get more games. You can hear good music on the computer. I like to do this. I know how to down- load the music.I like to buy stuff on the internet. My friends do this too. I can buy any- thing and just give a credit card number. I don't have to go the store.There are many, many things you can do on the internet right from your computer.
I have the internet. I do not use it a lot it takes to long to get things on it if you have to nd it out. If you have a computer you shud have it then you can rite on it and music but who nose how the music I like noone els likes I like hard rock what about you.65  If you have internet only 1 can use it so how do you no who it is and why te. If you have a movie more than 1 are alowd not just 1.But the internet has good purposes.

Visit the shoe department of a large department store and you will undoubt- edly see a variety of shoe styles on display. This suggests that the store is sat- isfying the customers' desire for an assortment of shoes.Logically, shoes should protect and support the feet. An example of such a shoe is the sneaker. Originally an inexpensive canvas, rubber soled version of a leather oxford (a shoe with laces), the sneaker has become increasing popular and has supplanted the oxford for regular everyday use for many students and some adults. Sneakers, like living things, have evolved and branched out. They are now mostly made of leather and have much cush- ioning to minimize stress on the wearer's joints. They have become spe- cialized into separate sneakers for walking, running, tennis, and basketball. There are sneakers for aerobic classes, and for the eclectic exerciser, there are cross trainers. There is justication for their popularity for they are comfortable and are engineered to properly support the foot during a par- ticular activity. It has also become acceptable to wear sneakers with street clothes because they just plain feel good. An endorsement by a popular ath- lete spreads their appeal as well as increases their cost.At the opposite end of the spectrum is a shoe style that is uncomfortable, harmful, and impractical. These adjectives describe the women's shoes with pointed toes and thin, high heels. Doctors say that the pointed toes cause deformities of the feet, and the three to four inch heels are unstable and can cause back problems. With so many negatives, why are these styles consis- tently popular? Wearers may admit that they are uncomfortable, but say that they are fashionable and that, in time, they get used to them. Histori- cally, people follow fashion, and here again, advertising preys upon this need to keep up with the current trends.A shoe that can be totally practical, simply fashionable, or a combination of both, is the boot. For cold or inclement weather, no footwear is as desir- able as an insulated, rubber-soled boot. Boots are popular because they are practical, long lasting, and a desirable fashion accessory. But there are boots whose entire function is fashion. Yes, these boots have the same pointed toes66  and spiked heels as the shoes described above, but they are boots because the leather continues high on the leg.Historically, shoe styles change, but there are some shoes that are com- fortable as well as fashionable, like sandals and sneakers. And, there are those styles some would consider fashionable but harmful to the feet, or worse. If the choice were between comfort or fashion, many people would probably risk discomfort in order to be fashionable.
Shoes are popular because they're necessary for doing almost anything. You need them to walk, play sports, and even to enter drug stores and restau- rants. Without them, you'd have to sit at home all day. Shoes also protect your feet when your walking on a hot sidewalk or hiking in the woods. Nowadays, people even use shoes to make fashion statements. Some shoes are more expensive than ever just because they're so popular.My favorite shoes are my sneakers. Everyone at school has sneakers because they're required for gym class. They're also popular outside of school because they come in so many colors and styles. I have a lot of friends at school but none of us has the exact same pair of sneakers. In high school, sneakers are a good way to express your personality, and on top of that they're really comfortable.Sandals are also popular, especially in the summer, because they're also comfortable and don't hurt your feet. You can move your toes around when you where them and they don't make your feet sweat like sneakers some- times do.I also have new high heel boots with a 4 inch heel. They hurt my feet when I wear them for a long time, but I don't care because they look so cool. I think looking good is worth the pain. Besides, I only wear them on spe- cial ocasions. My mother thinks I'll end up ruining my feet, but you should see the heels she wears to work!
I like shoe styles they are good. One time I went to buy shoes and my cuzin was there and we huged becuz we did not see each other for ever. We went to her house and watched tv. I need new sneakers. I like sneakers. They cost to much so I cant get them now. I want high heels my mother wears them and they kill her feet but I want them to. Everyone wants them.67

In her autobiographical novel, I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings, Maya Angelou relates her story as a poor black girl living in racially segregated Stamps, Arkansas. As the story unfolds, she describes relationships with her family and members of the community, her love of reading, her feeling of inequality, the racial prejudice she suffers, and her experiences as a single mother. What makes Angelou heroic, I think, is her perseverance over a multitude of odds.In the beginning of the novel, the reader learns that Angelou is living with her grandmother because her birth mother abandoned her. With no direction or positive inuence in her life, a white woman introduced her to "her rst white love" - William Shakespeare -who befriended Angelou. Reading became an escape from her reality. In real life, she weathered many hardships on her path to adulthood. What then makes Angelou a hero?The archetype of a hero usually involves hardship, struggle, and an ardu- ous journey. When this hero reaches a certain breaking point or climactic scene, a turn of events usually brings about resolution, self-awareness, and peace. This is true in Angelou's autobiography.164  Throughout the novel, racial prejudice is an overriding factor in her life. Even though Angelou documents her struggles against prejudice, lack of a formal education, and personal failure, she comes full circle when her son is born. She embarks on a new self-awareness and peace. There is a heroic quality about a woman who has overcome so many odds.Although Angelou is both author and subject, she embodies the spirit of a heroic character who ultimately prevailed against the odds.
An hero in my opinion is the author Maya Angelou. Often people think of heroes as sports stars or world leaders, but Maya Angelou is a hero.In Maya's book, I know why the caged bird Sings, Maya is really the main character. In fact, this is an autobiography of her life. In the book she goes through many hard times and has tough choices to make. The town she is from is in Arkansas, and it is a very racially divided town. Her grandmother is also raising her. One thing that Angelou loves to do is read. She meets a woman who shows her how to read, and well!I think she is a hero because she survived being a victim. Angelou was treated poorly because of her race, she was raped by a relative, abandoned by her mother, and becomes a mother herself. Similar to a hero, she has to be brave and strong-willed.I think Maya Angelou is a great person and a true hero.
A hero is a person who is in comic books and things, but did you know something about Miya Angeloo?She is a writer and she came from being very poor to becoming a success.In this essay I will talk abot angeloo.Well, maya had problems because some poeple are rasist, but she made her problems beter and even rote about them. And I think she is very nice and brave i hope everyone reades about this strong hero.

In literature, there are varying points of view in relaying the events. If the narrator was actually part of the events, this is called rst-person narration. When the narrator is merely telling a story, but was not part of the events, this is third-person narration. At times, a reader might be thankful that the narrator is only telling a story as the events unfold, especially if the main characters are in some sort of danger. I personally enjoy rst-person nar- ration because you are allowed into the mind of the main character. This was especially enjoyable while reading J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye.The main character, Holden Caueld, is the narrator as well. He is a very complex character who doesn't seem to t in socially. Salinger creates the world from Holden's point of view. Although Holden seems apathetic towards many things in his life such as his schoolwork and friends, he is a deeply sensitive character marred by his view of the world. For example, in the beginning of the novel, Holden questions why his roommates are so pop- ular and can converse so well, especially with members of the opposite sex. His insecurities are revealed so that the reader can explore his character and perhaps identify with him. If Salinger had written this as a third-person nar- ration, the reader might not understand Holden's character as well.Even though Holden Caueld is a tragic character, and many of his actions are not the most benecial, Salinger allows us to identify with Holden's inse- curities and private dealings, many of which the reader might identify with.
When the author is involved in the action in a book, it is called rst person narration. This is my favorite type of narration because you can understand what goes on in a character's mind. A good example is J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye.The story is told from the viewpoint of the main character, Holden Cau- eld. He is a very shy, withdrawn young man who is also sensitive. He sometimes wonders if he is like other people, and he is trying to nd him- self. I think many readers can identify with Holden from time to time. I think everyone feels insecure at one time or another.I think that Salinger chooses the narrator for this novel well. If this was writ- ten any other way, we might not sympathize with the main character as much.
I think 1st person narrator is a nice way to tell a story. In this essay you will hear about this narrator.160  In cather in the Rye, I forget the author, the story is told by the main character, Hulden. His is a boy who is afraid of everything! I can feel the way he did sometimes.This is why I like the narrator person one.

The familiar adage about selling one's soul to the devil conjures up two dis- tinct images-dabbling with the occult and being granted magical gifts.162  Although most people would not want to or would not dare to cross into such dangerous territory, Dr. John Faustus, the renowned scholar in this Elizabethan tragedy, could not resist.Christopher Marlowe, author of Dr. Faustus, created a complex charac- ter in the play of the same name. This character is tragic, foolish, ambitious, intelligent, and pitied. For all the good and bad traits he has, the audience cannot help but share in Faustus' regret at the end of the play.Faustus has mastered many disciplines and is a well-known scholar. How- ever, he yearns for more knowledge beyond the realm of what is offered. Faustus summons the occult and encounters a demon named Mephistophe- les, a servant to Lucifer. Faustus makes an offer to give his soul to the devil in exchange for twenty-four years of magic. Mephistopheles tries to dis- suade Faustus from such a fate, but Faustus persists until the deal has been made. Once this occurs, Faustus is ready to satisfy his ambitions.At this point in the play, the audience-although apprehensive about Faustus' choice-is just as curious as he was about magic and innite knowl- edge. Faustus wants to learn the secrets of the universe. He also wants a wife. Basically, he desires the things that most humans desire, and this is where Marlowe captures the audience's empathy. We know that what Faus- tus has done is immoral and tragic, but we want to share in this display of power as he entertains courts by summoning historical spirits. The audience has pity for Faustus when he has bouts with his conscience. For example, at one point he prays desperately to God for forgiveness, but the audience realizes that no matter how desperate or how much he pleads, the devil will make sure the contract is honored. What is particularly powerful at the end of the play is the torment and desperation Faustus experiences as he ghts the clock and tries to hold back time. But, the hours and minutes close in on his fate. Colleagues nd his body the next day, and the audience realizes that he has been dragged down to hell.Although the audience can blame Faustus for summoning the occult and bringing this tragedy on himself, Marlowe creates such a complex charac- ter that he is to be pitied for his choices.
Christopher Marlowe creates a character that can be both loathed for his attitude, but also pitied for his choices in Dr. Faustus.In this play, a young doctor with a lot of knowledge desires more from his studies. He realizes he can't get this knowledge from earth, so he sum- mons the help of the devil. The devil's servant, Mephistopheles, tries to163  convince Faustus that this is something he should not play around with. Faustus is persistent, so the deal with the devil is nally sealed in blood.Faustus enjoys his newly found powers, such as bringing up spirits. He does however have bouts with his conscience about his choices. The audi- ence feels pity for him because we would want his power, but we denitely don't want his fate. He tries to bargain and pray, but it is no use. The devil nally wins at the end, and we feel sorrowful for Faustus.In conclusion, even though Faustus does something that he knows he shouldn't have, the audience still feels pity for him when he has to trade in his soul.
The devil in the play Docter Faust plays a trick on him because he wants to be smarter. I think that Faust is a good man that does wrong.In the play he has magic but this does not help the devil or make Faust a smart man. He must go to hell when this is done, so he feels sorry for his- self. The people who watch the play fell bad for him to. Oh, well, he made his choice in life and now he is doomd.

One of the most important decisions young adults make is where to go to school. Your college education will affect the rest of your life, so you should weigh your options carefully. The "perfect" school may not exist, but I believe there are three factors that are integral to choosing the right college: location, size, and curriculum. You can narrow down your search based on these criteria.First, you should consider location. Some questions you should ask your- self include: Do I prefer to live in a city, the suburbs, or a rural area? Do I want to live in a temperate or colder climate? Do I prefer to be near my family, or in another part of the country? The answers to these questions will help you make the best choice.Second, you should consider size. Perhaps your high school experience78  will affect your choice of colleges. If you attended a small high school with a low teacher-student ratio, you may be accustomed to small class sizes and knowing your fellow students extremely well. On the other hand, if you attended a large high school, you may be used to new faces and larger classes. Would you prefer a school such as UCSB with 50,000 students, or a smaller school with fewer than 5,000 students? Remember, the attention you receive will be affected by the size of the student population.Finally, in order to choose the right college, you should take the time to decide what you would like to study. Although most colleges offer a myriad of courses, some schools specialize in certain elds and subjects or offer a wider selection of classes. For example, if you are interested in studying the Classics, did you know that the University of Texas has one of the best Clas- sics departments in the United States?Choosing the right college will require some effort. After you have decided the location, size, and curriculum you prefer, do some research. Learn about different colleges from your guidance counselor, the Internet, or from the colleges themselves. As with any important decision, make sure your choice is an educated one.
It's not easy to choose the right college. There are three things you should consider when applying and deciding on a college. These are: location, classes, and size.First of all, you should decide where you want to go to school for four years. Decide if you want to be in a city or in a rural area, or if you want to be near to or far from your family. Then, if you know what you want to study, you should make sure that the college offers classes. There would be no need to go to a school that does not teach the Classics, if that's what you want to study. Finally, you should think about whether you want to go to a school with alot of students or not too many. For example, there are more than 50,000 students at UCSB, but maybe you prefer to go to a school with only 5,000.When deciding on a college, take your time and consider all of these things. College is important for the rest of your life so choose wisely!
Evryone shoold go to college because that educasion are good for You. Its right to go to college becaus you need it for work and job's and life79  too. The right colege for You is one You like alot when You are done with hi-scool.

Whether professional or amateur, a baseball team, like a ne meal, needs the right ingredients to create a winning result. Talented athletes are the rst requirement. After that, astute coaching, which discerns and then develops the unique capabilities of the players, can be as important as the athletes themselves. Flexibility and the willingness to try different strategies are the hallmarks of winning coaches. All the talent in the world could be wasted without creative and shrewd coaching.A player with the ability to sprint, needed both for ineld defense and for speedy base running, can be invaluable. A fast runner can steal bases and get to rst base with a carefully placed bunt.Good pitching is essential for a winning baseball team. A pitcher who is "on" is the rst line of defense in baseball. It is well known that the pitcher is often the poorest hitter, but it is the pitcher who keeps the opponents from scoring. The pitcher's teammates accept this and acknowledge that it is their job to score the runs. Here again, a good coach decides who is the optimum pitcher for today's game, and equally important, when to take a tired or poorly performing pitcher out of the game.Recruiting strong and consistent batters will be a factor in creating a win- ning baseball team. Having a home run hitter with several players who can be counted on to get base hits and pinch hits are needed because the best pitching and the best elding will be for naught if runs aren't scored.Even with a plethora of natural ability, to become a winning baseball team, the players must continually practice, not only to maintain their skills, but also to improve them. In fact, a motivated player who practices diligently may eventually surpass those with superior natural ability that is not devel- oped. Along with this desire to continually improve one's individual playing ability, there is the motivation to succeed because of loyalty to the group. This type of esprit de corps can make the difference between a good and a win- ning baseball team. Putting the team rst, while striving to give one's all, puts the nishing touches on the recipe for a winning baseball team.77  
A winning baseball team would need good hitters, fast runners, a skilled pitcher and catcher, and a knowledgable and patient coach. It would also need to have a group of players who got along without any jealousy or hos- tility and were capable of rooting for each other.Good hitters and runners are important because you have to get alot of hits and runs to win. You can't win without scoring runs. Also, the runners need to be speedy, so they can get to the base before the ball gets there. You also have to have a skilled pitcher who can strike people out. The pitcher has to be good or else the other team will score more runs and you will lose. The catcher is important as well because if the catcher drops the ball when the pitcher throws it, that is an error.Finally, you also need to have a good coach who can help the players improve and who knows when to put certain players in the game and when to take them out. The coach should keep the team running smoothly and solve any ghts or disagreements.
I don't want to be on a baseball teem but I want to win if I do. My brother did and he never got a hit and he wont even look at me so who cars about baseball. I think you need to be a athleet and take lessons. And I think the uniforms are ugly I don't look good in it and it is swetty. I will pick the best players if I have to play so I mite as well win right.

Voting is the privilege for which wars have been fought, protests have been organized, and editorials have been written. "No taxation without repre- sentation," was a battle cry of the American Revolution. Women struggled for suffrage as did all minorities. Eighteen year olds clamored for the right to vote, saying that if they were old enough to go to war, they should be allowed to vote. Yet Americans have a deplorable voting history.Interviewing people about their voting habits is revealing. There are individuals who state, almost boastfully, that they have never voted. They somehow set themselves apart from the requirements of citizenship in a democracy. Many who avoid voting do so consciously. It is not as if they were ill or unavoidably detained on election day. Often they claim that their one vote doesn't matter. "What's one vote?" they ask. Perhaps one vote may not count in some elections, although there have been results determined by one or very few votes. In addition, the total of single votes that are not cast can add up to a signicant difference in a particular race. Some people blame the fact that they do not know enough about the issues for their absence from the voting booth. Others say that they avoid learning about the news because it is too depressing. In a democracy, we can express our opinions to our elected leaders, but more than half of us sometimes avoid choosing these people who make the policies that affect our lives.One of the effects of this statistic is that politicians will cater to the groups that do vote in large numbers, giving more weight to their needs than to those of other groups or of the general population. Since so many do not vote, elected ofcials can, with impunity, promote policies that ben- et the special interests that contribute nancially to the election cam-75  paigns. Another effect of not voting is the free rein given to those in ofce to disregard the expressed opinions of constituents. For if you do not vote, why should the candidate worry about you?It seems ironic that in this most democratic of societies, we abrogate the privilege for which so many have struggled. How many countries do not have a choice of candidates, yet their citizens are forced to participate in sham elections? In the United States we have choices. We can vote to re an ofceholder who does not live up to our expectations by choosing an opponent at the next election, and we are free to choose someone whose ideas appeal to us.Perhaps a major reason for not voting is the failure to convey how pre- cious and unique is the right to vote and how important is each and every vote. The major effect is that we are voluntarily giving up our rights as cit- izens to ascertain that our elected ofcials truly represent us. This is because we have not done our part in choosing them so in effect, we are telling these ofcials that we don't care enough to bother to vote.
Many people do not vote because they think its a hassle or that their vote won't make a difference. Some people say they don't care who wins, but everyone should care because government ofcials make decisions that effect all of us. People need to learn more about their own government. So many Americans think our government is made up of one person, the pres- ident! But there are so many other people involved and so many other elec- tions to think about too.Not having time to vote or not knowing who to vote for is no excuse for not voting at all. People should take the time to learn as much as they can about the people who are running and make an informed decision. If you don't vote then you'll never get what you want and you won't be able to complain when politicians make bad decisions.But if you're smart and vote for whoever you feel is the best candidate, then if that person is elected, you can know that it's their responsibility to listen to you. Our government is supposed to be for the people and run by the people, so everyone should realize it is their right and also their respons- bility to vote during every election.
Most people don't vote I wouldn't my mother don't she says she has no time she is so bizy she works and how can she vote if she works. My brother says76  if you vote you can called to the juree and who need that his friend had it and it was boring and he culdve lost his job. If you care who wins you shud vote if you don't care don't.

William Golding's novel The Lord of the Flies explores many themes such as the dark side of human nature, allegiances, and how these boys mirror larger society. I feel as if the producers of the popular television show "Sur- vivor" used this novel as the framework of their show. Both Golding's novel and the show have many similarities.When the show "Survivor" premiered, I immediately thought of the novel The Lord of the Flies. The novel is about a group of schoolboys who are ship- wrecked on a deserted island. The boys attempt to create a "civilization," but147  ultimately transform into mere savages. This is an important novel for the psychological study Golding presents. One can't help but draw parallels to adult society. There is a true need for structure and control in any society, but the means of that control makes this novel all the more interesting.One of the boys, Jack, is power-hungry and represents dictatorship. Some of the other boys such as Simon and Piggy try to do what is safe and conservative. The character of Ralph is symbolic of democracy and fairness. Throughout the novel, the boys engage in a power struggle and end up destroying one another. Golding's use of symbolism forces the reader to see characters and situations as larger ideas. The boys realize that they must create some type of order.Similar to the television show "Survivor", the boys hold council meet- ings, use objects as a symbol of strength, and use re as a symbol of hope. I remember watching the show and observing a contestant who won a phys- ical contest against the other players. This person was given a pillow to use, whereas the other contestants had nothing. The pillow symbolizes power, as did the conch in the novel. Also, whenever the show's council met on Sunday nights, they all brought their torches. When someone was voted off the island (seen as a liability or risk to the welfare of the group), that per- son's torch was extinguished, thus eliminating hope. Alliances were formed and these alliances pitted the contestants against each other. Ultimately the winner was the most cunning player who could convince the other mem- bers to follow them. This is exactly the situation that occurred between Ralph and Jack in the novel.William Golding's novel allows the reader to explore human nature and mankind. Often, we do not like to face the psychological aspects of our being. "Survivor" emulates the same underlying motives that form our nature.
In William Goldings The Lord of the Flies, I can draw many parallels between the group of boys in the story and the basis for the television show "Sur- vivor".In "Survivor", contestants are forced to live together on a deserted island for a prolonged period of time. The rules are to form alliances and not to be deceived by the other players. This is similar to what happens in the novel The Lord of the Flies. A group of shipwrecked boys must form a soci- ety in order to have structure. Jack and Ralph are the two leaders with totally different ways of order. One wants to be a dictator and the other wants to be democratic.148  Another similarity between the novel and the show is that they place importance on objects. In the book, the conch is symbolic of power. On the show, if someone wins a race or something, they get a prize and the others don't have anything! Also, both use re as a lifeline. In the show, when you are voted off the island, you must put out your torch. And both the show and novel have tribal meetings.I think the show "Survivor" and The Lord of the Flies tell about human nature and how societies are formed.
I like survivor on tv and it reminds me of that book about the boys who were the lords of the ies. In the book, boys have to come together to live on an island which is like castaway. In survivor they are put on an iland to survive too. I think the show is cool and the boys in the book destroy everyone!That is my essay on the survivor show and lord of the ies

Since they were rst domesticated, people have had relationships with ani- mals that have enhanced their lives. Probably animals that were trained to hunt and to retrieve prey were among the rst to become valuable to their owners. Useful animals include those used for transportation, for hauling loads, and, in recent times, to assist handicapped people. The latter are usu- ally dogs trained to guide the blind and to care for paraplegics. Although these animals have specic functions, it is probable that a special bond inevitably arises between them and the humans they serve and this goes far beyond the dependency each has for the other.Can a relationship with an animal improve a person's health? Many81  recent reports seem to suggest this possibility. Pets give us abundant and unconditional love. Always happy to see us, our pets allow us to be our- selves, to talk to them, and even to believe that they understand us. When we come home, we might feel reluctant to "talk to ourselves," but it is per- fectly all right to greet, chat, and interact with our dog, cat, bird, and even our sh. Some mental health workers are so insistent upon the benecial inuences of pets that they have an animal present during therapy sessions, claiming that this causes patients to be more relaxed and responsive. Stud- ies have proven that relationships with animals reduce stress and actually can measurably lower blood pressure.For people who are depressed or living alone, having a pet is not only therapeutic; it is a means of encouraging a healthier lifestyle. A pet owner must live according to a regular timetable so that the pet can be fed and cared for appropriately. For dog owners, there is an additional social ben- et that accrues from having to go outdoors for a walk. Encountering other dog walkers often leads to further social interaction and, perhaps, friend- ship. For cat owners, there is the admiration for the cat's characteristic inde- pendence, which makes any affection from the cat so much more meaningful. Keeping the bird feeders lled gives a sense of satisfying the needs of creatures that, in turn, delight us with their beauty and their antics. Other benecial effects of relationships with animals continue to be dis- covered. A recent article suggests that kindness to people and animals may be interconnected. Role-playing that increases children's empathy for ani- mals helps them not only psychologically, but also physically and socially. Another discovery shows that riding horses, for reasons not completely understood, has been shown to benet autistic children. Pet owners can now volunteer to take their pets to hospitals and nursing homes where res-idents seem to welcome them.It is probable that continued research will shed additional light on what happens when people and animals form a bond. For the present, it is cer- tain that almost anyone can benet from the resulting security, under- standing, fun, laughter, and love that come from having a pet.
I enjoy my pets. I have a cat and a bird and I like to spend time with them. When no one is home I play with my cat, or I may try to hold my bird. When I have a pet I feel good and happy. Some people have horses for pets. They get to ride them and take care of them. Even if you have a cat and don't have to take it for a walk you have to feed it.82  One of the good things about pets is it teaches you things. I learned that I have to take care of my pets. They need me to feed them every day. I think they look at me funny if I forget or if I am late. I no that little babies like to pet animals and that they like them. So there are relationship with ani- mals for all ages. Old people like animals to. If they live alone they can have someone to talk to. Pets are like friends.I no a blind man and he has a seeing dog and he goes all over with it. So he has a relationship with his dog. The dog helps him and he helps the dog by loving and taking care of it.Relationships with animals are good for both people and animals.
What are animals that have a relationship they are pets. I have a dog I hate to feed it and it shed but it wags its tale its kut. Wen I got the dog it was lit- tle and kut and now it isnt so kut because its to big. But I love it and he loves me not like my boyfreind who I don't have a relationship with. So I have a relationship with my pet it ushuly feel good.

Many times in Shakespeare's works, the setting changes from a city to a pas- toral venue. Although change in setting is expected, there is an underlying reason why he chooses these specic areas. In his play A Midsummer Night's Dream, the setting changes from the city of Athens to a forest near the city. The characters behave very differently in each setting.The play deals with marriages, love, family, and non-conformity. The Duke of Athens is about to be married to a woman who he recently defeated in war. Another element of the plot deals with a young woman whose father is demanding she marry a man she is not in love with. The woman decides to run away to the forest with the man she does love. There are two distinct settings here and I believe Shakespeare was mirroring human nature in the156  change of scenery. Often when someone is faced with a pressing problem or decision, they will retreat either physically to a quiet place to meditate, or they might go out with friends in order to take release from the issue or problem. Similarly in this play, the forest is viewed as a place of "non- reality," or a dream world. Fairies and supernatural beings inhabit the for- est. This is a place of refuge that contrasts the conformity of the city. There are, however, similarities in both settings.Just as the Duke of Athens is marrying Hippolyta, there is King Oberon and his queen in the forest. Both couples are learning about the trials of love. There are colorful characters in both venues that keep the audience enter- tained also. One such character who lives in the forest is Puck. Puck is a fairy-type character who plays tricks on the characters and ultimately tries to teach them lessons throughout the play. One of the more famous lines from Shakespeare is found in this work when Puck states, "Oh what fools these mortals be." There are lessons to be learned in both the city and the forest, but the forest is more of a dream world or an escape from reality.Shakespeare cleverly changes the setting in this play to expose human folly and lends keen insight into human nature.
The change in setting in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream is used to show contrast between a world of conformity and court life with a dream type world. Shakespeare does this to highlight human nature.In this play, there are two different worlds. One is the city of Athens where the Duke is about to be married. The city has its strict rules and con- formity. One part of the plot deals with a woman who doesn't want to marry the man her father wants her to. She decides to run away to the forest with the man she loves. The forest is now seen as an escape from reality. In the forest, there are fairies and other supernatural beings. People also do this in real life. If someone is sad, they may go down to the beach to think or just to be alone.There is a similarity in both worlds though. There is the Duke of Athens in the city, and there is King Oberon in the forest. They both are involved with their marriages and try to help others with their problems.I think Shakespeare does a great job using the city and the forest in this play to show two sides of human nature.
In this essay I will talk about shakespeare's play a midsummer night's dream and how this play uses the setting. The setting is the place where things157  happened. I think the woods and the city are good places for this play. One place is nice, but full of fairies and weird stuff. The city is more like real life and has real people. this is the difference of the setting in the play.

If you complain about the universality of math as a required subject, just try and spend one day without encountering some form of mathematics. From page numbers to prices to today's date, math puts things in order and enables us to compare quantitatively. Figuring how much time is required, how much of an ingredient must be measured, how much carpet to buy, all of these everyday experiences require familiarity with math. To survive nancially you must use math to allocate your resources. If you want to invest in a business or in the stock market you must know how to deal with the numbers. Understanding graphs and other analyses about the economy or politics or consumer condence are enhanced by the applications of math. Mathematical applications in the study of science are essential. Track- ing the orbits of planets and the locations of stars in the galaxy cannot be done without numerical comparisons. Every discipline, from archeology to zoology, benets in some way from the use of mathematics.Practical reasons for the need for mathematics are omnipresent, but there are other, perhaps more esoteric reasons, for interest in this subject. The amazing coincidences found in numbers provide continual fascination. An example is the fact that the sum of the numbers in the products of the "9-times table" add up to nine. Nine times ve equals forty-ve, and four plus ve equals nine. Similarly, the numbers in the product of seven times nine also equal nine. Mathematicians are also especially fascinated with unique geometric relationships. An example is the fact that three pyramids of the same height will exactly t into a prism of equal height.A teacher of mathematics once told me, "Math is in everything," and some people say, "Mathematics is the something for which the world was written." These are reasons enough for requiring its study.
Math is a required subject because it is important in school and in every day life. If you don't understand simple math, you'll never know if the cashier is giving you the right change or if your getting a good deal on a new car. Without math, shopping would be impossible. You wouldn't be able to g- ure out what you could afford. Some people think they don't need math but they do. You need math to know if its hot or cold outside or to know what pages you have to study for a particular test.68  Math is also important because you need to use it in almost every other subject. Sometimes you need math in science to make a graph or to meas- ure amounts for an experiment. There's no way you could pass science with- out math. I use math in history class to remember dates and in English class we use it to understand poetry. You can't even write a haiku without math because you wouldnt be able to count the number of syllables and lines.In every day life, you need math to balance your checkbook and to know how much time you have before the movie starts. Without it, you'd never be on time, and your friends would hate you. Math is necessary even to make a simple phone call. When you think about it numbers are everywhere so it's important to understand them.
We have to take math. I don't like it. It is stupid. We have to draw in the boxes on graf paper what is this art. I faled art anyway so why do it in math. I can use the kalkuate so I don't even need to study it where allowd to use the kalkuate and so I do not care if math is important.

I often complained about our lack of wealth to my parents, who often replied that I had no idea what it means to be poor and that someday they'd show me what poverty was really like. I thought they were all talk, but one day, they proved me wrong-and showed me just how right they were, and they said I would see.I did see, and the images from that day still haunt me. My parents were very active in their church, and they had arranged to deliver clothing and food donations to a church in a deeply impoverished area on the edge of the Appalachian Mountains, a four-hour drive from our home.I'd seen pictures of poverty before, of course. But seeing a picture of a shack with seven malnourished children and actually walking into such a shack are two entirely different things. The pastor of the church took us into a few homes so we could deliver some of the items (a crib, a box of linens, canned goods) personally. I had never felt so uncomfortable before. These people had so little! Eight family members living in two rooms . . . no electricity or running water . . . no couches or microwaves or cable tel- evision . . . soon I began to realize just how lucky I was. True, I didn't have as much as my friends. But I had so much more than the people we visited that day. I felt greedy and guilty for having so many things.When we got back home, I got on the Internet and found a soup kitchen not too far from our home. I've been volunteering there twice a week ever since. Two of my friends have joined me. Every time we go, we count our blessings.
On one afternoon I'll never forget, my parents taught me to appreciate what I have. We lived in a very rich neighborhood but we ourselves were not rich, we were only middle class. Therefore I always felt like I was poor; compared to all my friends and their fancy houses and pools and cars. None of my friends had to work; but I had to work, to afford my car.I guess my parents got tired, of me complaining, so one day they woke115  me up really early and took me on a long drive to a really poor neighbor- hood. I mean this place was really, really poor. I never saw such poverty before. The people, they lived in shacks, not houses. Everything was dirty, they had nothing like we have in our houses, most of them didn't even have running water or even electricity. And so many people living in such a lit- tle shack, with everyone on top of each other.We went there to deliver some food and clothing donations to a church. The paster, he took us to some houses to deliver some of the food and clothes ourselves. Thus, I could see for myself how much I really had.When I got back home, I found a soup kitchen I could go to help other people who really don't have anything, not even food to eat. They always remind me to count my blessings.
I am told "to count your blessings" and appreciate someone or something that you'd taken for granted. Many movies and books are about this. I am sure you have seen some and read some. Like scary movies where people get killed can make us apreciate the blessing, we are still alive. Or a war movie, that were not ghting a war. When I went to a poor town once when I was in school I saw people even more poor than me. That made me sad, they live with so little. Compared to how much I have. All the time I felt poor since my friends, they were so rich.

Personication is a clever technique wherein non-human characters are given human characteristics. Using this technique, the reader is able to understand how an animal feels, or what a tree is thinking, or even the most intimate thoughts of an old pair of sneakers! Rudyard Kipling's "Rikki- Tikki-Tavi" is one of my favorite short stories. In it, all of the animals are personied, which is crucial because the protagonist is a mongoose.Rikki-Tikki-Tavi is a small mongoose who nearly drowns after a ood sweeps him away from his home. A boy named Teddy nds the mongoose, and he and his mother nurse the animal back to health. Rikki never con- verses in English with his human family, however he does interact with the other animals in the garden, speaking in English. I nd this technique to be helpful in formulating the plot. For example, a mongoose's natural enemy is the cobra. Kipling uses these two enemies in the wild and makes them the protagonist and antagonist of the short story. Throughout the story, Rikki- Tikki nds himself battling adversaries in the garden in an effort to save Teddy's family.This story follows the archetype of the battle between good and evil. If we look closely at the plot, biblical themes are apparent. Snakes in the gar- den may remind some of the biblical story of Adam and Eve. Without per- sonication in this biblical story, Eve might not have been tempted if the serpent didn't have the ability to speak. Although Rikki-Tikki cannot con- verse with the humans in the story, the reader is able to understand his char- acter and his thoughts. For example, before he battles Nag, the male antagonist serpent, he is cautious and a bit nervous. However, he won't show his fear to his enemy. Only the reader understands Rikki's character from this point of view.Rudyard Kipling was clever enough to observe what occurs in nature, blending it with personication, and creating a timeless story of good ver- sus evil.
Personication is the technique where the author gives non-human char- acters human thoughts, speech, and feelings. I like how this is used in Rud- yard Kipling's Rikki-Tikki-Tavi.Without personication, the main character, who is a mongoose, would not be able to express his feelings. The story would need a narrator, like the kind you see on television's Wild Discovery. Some of those documentaries show animals in the wild, while a narrator tells the audience why the ani-155  mals behave certain ways. With personication, a non-ctional event can be ctionalized.For example, a mongoose's natural enemy in the wild is the cobra. In Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, the mongoose is the hero, while the cobra is the villain. Both animals have conversations with other animals and the reader can see what they are thinking about. Rikki-Tikki is nervous to ght the cobras, but doesn't show it when he starts to battle. I like how the author lets the story unfold through personication.Although Rikki can't talk with his human family, he behaves like a fam- ily pet. When the cobras plot to kill the family, Rikki defends them by killing the snakes. This story follows the common theme of good versus evil. Without personication, the story would not be so enjoyable.
Personication sounds like person, and that is what it means. When a writer gives something words and feelings, it is called personication. In this essay, I will tell you about personication.Rikki-Tikki is a animul who can talk and have conersashuns with other animuls. He ghts snakes and wins!

Is your favorite place in the home sitting on the couch in front of the tele- vision? Do you spend hours and hours there each day, surrounded by bags of chips and cans of soda? Do you panic when you can't nd the remote control and think that you might actually have to get up off of the sofa to change the channel?If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, you are not alone. In fact, you are one of the millions of Americans who are "couch potatoes": peo- ple who spend their days and nights "vegging out" in front of the "tube."Well, spud, it's time to get up out of that armchair and get some exercise! I know how seductive television can be. I know how easy it is to plop onto the sofa and lose yourself in the world of sports, reality shows, and good- old make-believe. I know how mesmerizing MTV and other channels can be and how hard it can be to pull yourself away. But all that television spells disaster for your body because it needs to be active to be healthy. And it'sno good for your mental health or social life, either.Think about what all that time in front of the television is doing to your body. Think about what all that sagging muscle and growing belly is doing to your life. Think about how your lack of energy affects you at work.Now think about how different things would be if you spent some of that31  TV time getting exercise instead: You would feel better during the day. You would sleep better at night. You would have more energy. You would look better. You would have more condence. You would be more creative. You would be healthier and happier. And you would not even miss the television. What sort of exercise can you do? Anything! Go for a walk. Ride a bike.Jog. Lift weights. Take an aerobics class. Do yoga. Join a basketball or hockey league. Swim. Roller blade. Grab a friend, a fellow couch potato, and exercise together.You can start with just fteen minutes a day, two or three days a week, and build up slowly. Before you know it, your couch potato days will be over, and you will wonder how on earth you ever spent so much time in front of the TV.
Americans everywhere are "couch potatoes." These are people who just sit in front of the TV all day and night. They spend so much time on the couch they're almost becoming part of the couch. They don't ever want to get up to change the channel, so the remote control is like a part of their hand. Is that what you're like? Do you spend too much time in front of the TV? Well, it's time to stop being a couch potato. You need to take care of your body. It's time for you to get up and get some excercise.If you lay around all day, think of how that's just not good for you. It's not healthy. You need to get excercise to be healthy. Physical activity at least three times a week will get you back in shape. It will help you have a healthy heart, better sleep, and less likely to get sick and diseases because your immune system will be stronger. Furthermore, you'll have more energy and just feel better. This is especially good for you at work. In addition, you'll be more condent because you will look better and t into nicer clothes. When you feel better about yourself, you're happier.Its easy to get excercise. You can do some jumping jacks or jog or play tennis. Even just walking to the store instead of driving can help. Maybe you could join a gym or a sports team, like a basketball team in your neigh- borhood. Or ask a friend whose also a couch potato to excercise with you. Its easier when you have someone to excercise with.So do yourself a favor, stop spending so much time in front of the TV!You'll be proud when your days as a couch potato are over.
For some people's thinking, there are to many "couch potatos", all across the American country. There are lying on there couchs all the time, doing32  nothing. Except watching the TV all the time. Whereas they not getting any excersizing, not anything at all. Theres so much to do, like jogging or walking or tennis instead.The couch potatos, they should not be just on the couch, but also excer- sizing. Think about being this like a potato. Is not a good thing! Instead, to be like a lion or strong like a bull.

It's a fact: There are students across the United States who are vegetar- ian and/or health conscious, and school cafeterias should be required to provide low-fat and/or vegetarian lunch options for them. Even more importantly, many teenagers' dietary decisions are not only based on health concerns but also religious and/or moral issues. In this day and age, an individual's eating habits often reect his or her identity. For these rea- sons, it's imperative that each school's cafeteria menu be as diverse as its student body.Just by reading headlines in any of the major news magazines, it becomes clear that the United States is a nation that needs to slim down. In every town and city, there are an abundance of fast food restaurants that lure teenage customers with fast, inexpensive, and tasty food, but these foods are typically unhealthy. Unfortunately, school cafeterias, in an effort to provide food that is appetizing to young people, mimic fast food menus, often serv- ing items such as burgers and fries, pizza, hot dogs, and fried chicken. While these foods do provide some nutritional value, they are relatively high in fat, and many of them, namely burgers, hot dogs, and fried chicken, are clearly not designed for vegetarians.Many of the lunch selections currently offered by most school cafeterias could be made vegetarian and/or more healthy with a few simple and inex- pensive substitutions. Veggie burgers, for example, offered alongside beef burgers, would give both vegetarians and the health conscious more options. A salad bar woud also serve the dual purpose of providing both veg- etarians and low-fat food eaters the opportunity for a satisfying meal. This is not to say that accommodating every desire or food preference is plausi- ble, but students should have the right to be served foods that coincide with their life choices.
In the United States there are many people who are vegetarian. In addi- tion, there are people who choose to eat low-fat foods, either to lose weight or to stay healthy. Many of these people are students who eat lunch at their39  school cafeterias on a daily basis. Surprisingly though, school cafeterias are not required to provide low-fat nor vegetarian options for students.Unfortunately, vegetarian options may be limited to the french fries (served with burgers) or pizza. While these are vegetarian (non-meat) options, they do not necesarily serve as low-fat foods. I think schools should have a wider variety of low-fat and/or vegetarian options such as a salad bar, or perhaps even something with tofu.While cafeterias can't meet all the demands of students, it is important to offer those commited to a healthy or vegetarian lifestyle the choice. Schools should create a menu that offers these options for all students.
Lot's of people are overwait and even fat, and the other people are vege- taran who dont eat meat. The food at schools are bad enouf and then why should they hafe to have stuff that those people like. School's shoudl have good food and meat, but not fat food for everyone.

The theme "coming of age" is a common one, where an adolescent boy or girl is faced with decisions that ultimately lead them into adulthood. Barn Burning, by William Faulkner, embodies this theme with messages of fam- ily loyalty and morality.The story is set in the South, roughly thirty years after the Civil War. The main character who comes of age is Sarty Snopes, an adolescent whose father, Ab Snopes is a poor sharecropper frustrated by the post-Civil War Aristocracy. Sarty's father is a very destructive, immoral character. In the South at this time, if a person wanted to deliver the most potent form of revenge against their neighbor, they would have someone burn their barn down. This crude assault makes perfect sense considering the main income providing lot was agriculture and livestock. If a person lost their barn where these things were stored, their lives would ultimately be ruined. Ab and his son drift from place to place, and Ab makes money as a hired "hit" for barns. His son is deeply troubled by his father's destructiveness, but follows along out of "blood," or the loyalty of family regardless of the activities.Throughout the novel, Sarty is faced with internal conict. He knows that his father is doing something highly illegal and immoral; however, he wishes to remain loyal to family. Faulkner explores this coming of age theme with real depth and conviction, as the boy struggles with his conscience.The climax of this novel comes when the boy and his father are taken in by a warm, friendly man who provides the two with meals, lodging, and conversation. Sarty takes a genuine liking to the man; however, he knows that his father plans to burn the man's barn down. Although he tries to con- vince his father not to commit this heinous act, Ab takes the boy in the mid- dle of the night towards the barn. Sarty makes the hardest decision of his life and warns the man. In the closing scene, a gunshot is heard and the161  reader can assume that the father has been caught and killed. Sarty has crossed the threshold of pre-adolescence and has deceived "blood" in order to preserve his morality.William Faulkner's Barn Burning is a remarkable story of coming of age, where a boy must make the ultimate decision and thus becomes a man.
Barn Burning, by William Faulkner, is a great story that has the theme com- ing of age. In this story, a young boy must decide whether to follow his father in committing unlawful acts, or listen to his own conscience.Barn Burning takes place in the South, after the Civil War. The boy, Sarty Snopes, and his father, Ab, travel from place to place, hired to burn down barns. Ab is a sharecropper who is angry at the society of the South. Dur- ing this time, it was the worst thing you could do to someone, burning down their barn. This is where a person would make all of their money, so it was the ultimate slap in the face if you wanted revenge on someone. Sarty doesn't like what his dad does, but stays with him because it's his family duty. He is conicted on whether to follow hi father or do what he knows is right. Sarty and his dad are taken in by a man on a plantation and treated very nicely. Sarty begins to really like this man, however he knows that his father is planning to burn down his barn. Sarty is faced with turning in his father or being loyal. In the end, he turns his dad in and this is where he nallycomes of age. I think this was a very powerful story.
In this essay, I will tell you about to come to age in Barn Burning. This story was wen a man and his son burn barns, but the boy does not want to do it. He tries to think about what is right, but he wants to stick with blood. His family should not snitch. Barn burning was very bad in this time near the civil war, so The boy at the end turns in his father and becomes a man. That is my essay on barn Burning.

Theme is the underlying message an author presents to his or her audience. Many times the theme of a work is apparent. Often we ask ourselves upon completing a novel, "What did that character learn at the end?" We base our judgment of characters on our cultural beliefs and emotions we expe- rience in our lives. In Herman Hesse's Siddartha, the theme seems appar- ent-fulllment in life through spiritual peace.The main character, Siddartha, takes the reader on his life's journey to nd truth and meaning in life. He decides to leave home with his childhood friend, Govinda. The setting of this story is India, with the social caste system as the motivation for his journey. Siddartha realizes that he yearns for more knowl- edge and understanding; far more that his father can provide him with. He seeks spiritual fulllment and wisdom. Even though this story is set in India, the theme is universal. Just as many of us decide to go on to college to learn more about the world, and ourselves; Siddartha does the same.At different stages of his journey he acquires wisdom, learns as much as he can, and forges on to new experiences. Siddartha is not unlike a person today in our culture. Many of us challenge ourselves with new ideas and experiences. Sometimes we fail, other times we succeed. However, what uni- es us is the desire to explore the unknown. The trade-off is we may discover we are much happier after taking those risks, than if we never ventured out. This is the theme in Siddartha. It is the message that is universal. In fact, there is a very popular book out now about moving cheese. It is a metaphor for the same theme as in Siddartha. Moving out of our comfort zones into a new, unfamiliar arena, hoping to nd what it is we are looking for.Siddartha goes through both pleasant and unpleasant experiences in this novel. At one point, he acquires incredible wealth and has every material possession he could ever dream of. However, at this point in his life, he con-151  templates suicide! He has become so gluttonous that he sickens himself. He realizes material possessions cannot bring him peace. From this scene, the theme of attaining spiritual peace is strengthened. How many times have we come across people with enormous wealth, but little peace and fulllment in their lives?Siddartha is a great novel and its theme is apparent. The quest for spiri- tual peace, wisdom, and self-understanding is unpredictable, but attainable through the trials of life and what it has to offer.
The theme of a literary work is the main idea, or message that we under- stand. Many times the theme is not stated directly, but the reader can usu- ally gure it out. One particular novel I enjoyed reading was Siddartha by Herman Hesse. In this novel, a young man begins his life's journey towards spirituality and understanding. This is a common theme in literature.While Siddartha is still a young man, he asks his father to explain certain things to him about life and religion. His father doesn't have all the answers for him, so Siddartha decides to leave home and try to nd the answers for himself. He brings along his friend Govinda. This book takes place in India; that is the reason for the unfamiliar names. Siddartha and his friend encounter many new people and experiences.Towards the end of his journey, Siddartha has discovered many things about himself. He realizes that possessions cannot make him happy. He becomes aware that true happiness and peace are found inside.This theme is very common in literature. I think this is true because peo- ple everywhere go through what Siddartha did sometime in their life.
Theme is where you can tell what a writer is thinking about. I think that sometimes writers like to fool with people and guess real hard to see if they can understand.In Siddartha, a book about a boy who tries to see about life, I think the theme is about a boy in India who likes to go on trips and helps people.That is my essay about theme. I hope you liked this essay.152

When he was at the height of his basketball career, Michael Jordan was making approximately $300,000 per game. That's more than most people make in a year; indeed, it's more than some people earn in a lifetime. Yes, Michael Jordan was a phenomenal basketball player. Yes, he was also a fan- tastic role model. But no, he did not deserve to earn such a ridiculously high salary. Jordan, like many other top professional athletes, was grossly over- paid.Why do top athletes earn such inated salaries? Because they bring big bucks into their cities and franchises. But what sort of service do they pro- vide to society? Do they save lives? No. Do they improve the standard of living or promote positive social change? No. Do they help keep our streets safe or educate our kids? No. True, many of the top athletes are good role models for our children. But seven-gure salaries don't always mean model behavior. Take N.B.A. star Latrell Spreewell, for example, who choked and threatened to kill his coach.It is true that professional athletes work hard, and many have spent their lives pursuing their goals. It is also true that most professional athletes have a relatively short career span-a decade perhaps at the top of their game. Limited as their professional sporting career may be, they don't deserve such high salaries. After their professional sports careers are over, they can certainly pursue other careers and work "regular" jobs like the rest of us. Ending their stint as professional athletes doesn't mean they have to stop earning incomes. They just have to earn incomes in a different way. Why should they be any different from the rest of us who may need to switch careers?It is also true that professional athletes may be injured while on the job; their work is indeed physical, and especially in contact sports like football, injuries are bound to happen. But, like the rest of us, they have insurance, and in nearly all cases, their exorbitant salaries more than cover their med- ical costs. And theirs is not the only high-risk job. What about miners, con-35  struction workers, or reghters? They are at risk for physical injury every day, too-injuries that could likewise end their careers. But they sure aren't earning millions of dollars a year.It is also true that professional athletes may spend years and years prac- ticing with farm teams for a fraction of the salary they receive once they make it to the top. But in every career path, we start off with lower wages and must pay our dues and work our way up. Besides, farm team salaries are not always so low.We're a sports-crazy country, a nation of fanatic sports fans and celebrity worshippers. We're awed and entertained by the best of them-the Michael Jordans, the Alex Rodriguezes, the Emmitt Smiths. But as much as they may inspire and amuse us, professional athletes do not deserve such high salaries. Those millions could be much more wisely spent.
Do athletes get paid too much? You bet. That's my opinion.Professional athletes, what do they do with all that money? Imagine Michael Jordan earning $300,000 per game! Plus all his money from Nike and other advertising. I think that money can be put to much better use in this country.Professional athletes should get good salaries, but not the millions like they get now. It's just too much. Their job isn't dangerous, except maybe for football or ice hockey where it's easy to get a bad injury. It's easy to get a bad injury in lots of other jobs, too, like construction, but they don't get millions of dollars. I guess, the difference is that nobody likes to watch construction workers. There's fun in the game and people like the competition, sports teams bring lots of money into a city's economy.If professional athletes could guarantee they'd also be a good role model for kids, then maybe they could have such high salaries. Because they'd be doing something good for society since so many kids are watching. For now though, it's too much.
Today the athleets so much money. Millions an millions of the dollars. They playing baseball, basketball; football, even for golf. This is the not of the dangerous sport, even less than many of the others.The money, it's too much, giving mine opinon. For the teems and the citys its so much there's else to pay for with the money, like homelessness. This is the need to be changed.36

Writers for TV sitcoms or movies are fortunate. Visuals often convey tone much more conveniently than words. Writers have to be very skillful in word choice in order to evoke emotions. While I began to explore Edgar Allan Poe's works, I was intrigued with the way Poe carefully chose lan- guage and with the way it evoked a very certain mood or tone.In Poe's "The Tell-Tale Heart", I was amazed with the way the main character could grow to hate someone's physical appearance so much so that he could stare at him for hours on end. The plot of this story revolves around a young man who rents a room from an elderly man in a large, dark mansion. This is how Poe begins to create the tone or mood. If the setting were in a house with a white picket fence in Pleasantville, the setting might not be as effective for suspense or horror. However, Poe begins to master- fully build suspense in "The Tell-Tale Heart". For example, the deranged tenant slowly opens the elderly man's bedroom door at night and stares at his glass eye for hours in a seething rage. He does this numerous times, to where the reader begins to understand that this man is far from normal. His obsession leads him to commit a horrible crime.The rage this man feels about the eye nally comes to a point wherein he attacks the man and suffocates him in his bed. Afterwards, he dismem- bers his corpse and hides the pieces under the oorboards. By now, the reader is in complete disbelief and awe at such a heinous, non-provoked attack, that we must continue reading. The tone becomes very eerie, and will soon turn suspenseful.Finally, the police investigate the home after a neighbor reported hear- ing screams coming from the house. The deranged man invites the police in, and invites them to sit with him in the room where the corpse lies. Poe now adds to the tone with more suspense and a feeling of anxiety to whether the man will confess to the murder. While speaking with the police, the man begins to hear a faint heartbeat that continues to grow in volume. However, he is the only one who hears the noise. The man attempted to cunningly fool the police ofcers while sitting on the corpse, only to now mentally break down from the noise inside his mind to where he confesses. The torture this man evokes on himself adds tremendously to the tone of the story.Just as Poe creates an eerie, intense, and twisted tone to his ction, authors can lead their readers to feel certain emotions through their writing.146  
Tone can be called the way an author makes you feel while reading their work. I personally have been frightened, brought to tears, extremely angry, and have laughed out loud simply by the way an author creates the tone of a story. This is also very similar to what an audience experiences while watching a lm.I recall one work I read by Edgar Allen Poe called The Telltale Heart, which has a bizarre, twisted tone.Initially, I thought this story was simply about a man who takes in a stranger. However, the tone of the story became strange when the tenant stares at his landlord while he sleeps. Poe leads us into the mind of a madman. I was on the edge of my seat as the police were asking questions of the man. The tone of the story, or the mood, was both frightening and suspenseful.I enjoy reading all types of books because many times the tone is differ- ent. I especially like Poe's stories because I now know how he used tone in his twisted tales.
Tone is like when the writor makes you feel good when you read books. I like to read a lot. In this essay I will tell you about tone.I like many books that have tone. If you don't have tone, then sometimes I don't like to read these kinds. I like to read books about animuls, cars, and misteries. I really like misteries because you try an gure out what happens.In this essay I have told you about tone.

I was never one to believe in things like miracles or fate, but since my acci- dent a few months ago, I look at things a little differently. Whether it was a miracle, or fate, or just plain luck, I'm still here to tell this story.It was a Monday morning, just about 8:15. I was actually a little early for once and was glad I didn't have to race to work. It was my second week as a bank teller at Harrison Savings and Loan.There had been some freezing rain earlier that morning, but the roads seemed clear as I pulled out of the driveway. I turned left at the light, right at the Dunkin Donuts, and then left again onto the onramp for Route 61. I sped up to merge with the oncoming rush-hour trafc when suddenly I felt my car, a brand new Durango, lose control. I'd hit a patch of ice.What happened next probably lasted no more than fteen seconds, but if felt like hours. I spun around like a top, turning two full revolutions as I crossed the two southbound lanes. Then I hit the median strip and the car ipped over as it crossed into the northbound trafc. I skidded across the highway and the car stopped in the right-hand lane. There I was, upside- down and backwards, after crashing across four lanes, and somehow I was alive. Somehow I hadn't hit a single car.125  But I had no time to appreciate that miracle, because when I looked out the shattered windshield, I saw an 18-wheeler was bearing down upon me at about 65 miles an hour. There was no time to get out of the car.I screamed and braced myself for the impact. But instead of hearing the crunch of metal crashing into metal, I heard the screeching of brakes as the truck swerved around me, just in time to avoid a head-on collision. The truck skidded to a stop on the shoulder about a hundred feet away from me. Then the driver jumped out and ran over to see if I was okay.That night at home, I eased my aching body into bed. But I was climb- ing into my own bed, in my own room, not in the hospital. Somehow, the only injuries I sustained were a few cuts on my face and hands, a bruised right shoulder, and two bruised calf muscles. My new car was totaled, but I didn't care. All that mattered was that I was alive.
I was involved in a really terrible accident not long ago, and I'm very lucky to be alive. I was on my way to work at my new job when I hit a patch of ice as I was pulling onto a major highway. It's a miracle I didn't get seriously hurt.When I hit the patch of ice, my car, my brand new Durango, that I was so proud of, lost control. I started spinning around like a top. I spun across the two north-bound lanes. Then my car hit the median strip and ipped over.I thought, I ought to be dead already, but I wasn't. But it wasn't over yet. Now I went across the south bound lanes upsidedown. I stopped in the right hand lane and then I saw a big truck headed straight towards me.Somehow, I don't know how, that truck managed to stop before it crashed into me. It swerved around me and saved my life. Then the driver got out to see if I was ok.Luckily, I was OK. I only had just a few cuts and bruises and I bruised both of my calf muscles. My car was totaled, but, that didn't matter. I was just happy to be alive.
One time I had bad accident. That almost got me killed. I hit a pach of ice. When I was go onto high way I spinned around a lot. Across all for lanes. First I hit the midean stripe that made my car ipped over. I was upside down thanking I was still a live. When a big truck was coming at me. There wasnt no time to got out. It was my brand new car that was totalled. I was126  ok after all that lucky for me my car wrecked but not me. The truck he stop on time and move around my car upsidedown still. He jump to see if I ok.In hospital doctors say I ok. Just many number of bruises and cuts and some on my calfs and shoulder. I am ok all thogh my car it ruined.

Have you ever read a story that ultimately changed the way in which you thought about the world?So often we form our opinions and lifestyles from our families and what we observe around us. Could it be possible that a novel might change the way in people's thinking? After reading Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird, I realized for the rst time how complex racism was, and the necessity for societal change.I have always been aware of cultural and racial differences in others. I was raised to accept people for their differences and judge people solely on their character. However, I wasn't aware of the problems encountered by black people in the Deep South during the 1940s. In her novel, Lee makes it apparent that the color of skin was a determinant of social stature, no mat- ter your character.I felt that having a rst person narrator, told from the perspective of a young girl in the South was a brilliant way to tell this story. Scout is at the age where she is only beginning to understand how society handles diver- sity and cultural differences. A black man, Tom Robinson, is accused of rap- ing a white woman, even though none of the evidence points to him. For example, the narrator is a young girl named Scout. Her father, Atticus149  Finch, is a well-respected, highly moral lawyer who is defending Tom. Even though Atticus nds evidence contrary to the accusations, he has no hope of winning this trial. Scout ghts a boy in her class who tells her that her father is defending a "(racial slur)". Scout now begins to come to terms with her assumptions about people.An interesting point is made in this novel. While the white people of this small town in Alabama discuss the horrors of Hitler persecuting Jewish peo- ple, Scout wonders how the same people could not understand that the white people of her town were doing the same to the blacks. This sends a powerful message to the reader through such a vivid analogy.This novel elicits the reader to think about race relations and social big- otry. There are decent, moral black characters in this novel that are doomed because of their skin color. However, Lee portrays low class white families, such as Bob's, undeserving of respect, but able to live on a much higher social stature than the blacks. When Tom Robinson is killed escaping from prison, the town barely takes notice.Through Lee's novel, society is faced with the vulgarities of race and social class, along with the racism of this Southern town. Her message that neither race nor class, but actions, dene someone's character leave the reader with important social issues to be re-examined.
In Harper Lee's novel To Kill A Mockingbird, many racial issues are brought into the story for the reader to think about. I think Lee does a nice job of bringing these issues to light.Atticus Finch, a white lawyer, defending Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman, sees that he has no chance of winning this case in this small Southern town, set in the 1940's. Finch's daughter, Scout, tells the story. I liked how Lee used Scout to tell the story, because it was from a child's point of view. Scout must face prejudiced people in the novel who make fun of her father for taking this case, even though her father is respected.Many things in the novel make the reader feel horrible for the treatment of black people in this town. None of the evidence points to Tom, and even when he is shot at the end of the novel, no one seems to even care.I really believe because of this book, that many people's ideas about race have been changed. I think that people should be treated with respect no matter the color of their skin.150  
In this essay, I will write about how a book can change peeple's mind. If you ever read To Kill A Mockingbird, you would see why. A small girl tells this stiory and a black man is being in court because people think he rapped a wehite woman. The reader no's this isn't true, but the town in the south don't believe him. When I read this I was sad because of the way people get picked on. This is my essay on changing society. Thank you.

Dear Ms. Jones:Your class was one of the most informative I have ever taken, and I84  learned a tremendous amount in the relatively short time of one semester. Therefore, I felt obliged to write to you when I received the disappointing grade of "C" on my term paper.Checking the criteria you provided and thoroughly discussed in class, I felt that I complied with each one in a superior manner, not just passably, as reected in my grade. Four arguments in support of my thesis were stated and each was in turn discussed with several relevant examples given. You required only three arguments. Bibliographical citations were given in the exact format you demonstrated in class. As suggested, Internet sites were used in addition to rst-person accounts and editorial material.Although I spent an inordinate amount of time on this project , I felt it to be most worthwhile because it was a wonderful learning experience. When I saw the grade on the paper, I looked in vain for comments or sug- gestions. It would be helpful to me if I understood how you arrived at this grade. Would it be possible for us to arrange a meeting, during which time you could offer hints about what you felt was lacking in my work, and, per- haps, I could hope that you might reconsider and raise my grade.Thank you for your kind consideration of this request.Sincerely yours, Your Student
Dear Ms. Jones:I was really upset at my grade. I don't think I am a C student. I tried hard and got some B's a few times. Don't you think I did everything on the checklist you gave us? I had the right number of examples and I tried to tell a little about the examples. There was only one where I couldn't get an example, but does that mean I get a C?I worked hard on this and I think anyone would get a C even if they didn't work so hard. I never did such a long paper. I hope you noticed the good bibliography. I copied it just the way you showed it. And you didn't write any corrections so what was wrong with it?Could you tell me what was wrong with it. I think I should get at least a B.Sincerely yours, Your Student85

Robert Frost's comforting, sad, and often poignant poetry is usually lled with metaphors and vivid imagery. Perhaps my favorite Frost poem is "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening." The imagery creates a memo- rable portrait of the beauty and power of nature.165  Near the beginning, the narrator is introduced as a working man, who has stopped to rest: "My little horse must think it queer / To stop without a farmhouse near." The narrator suggests that his days are mostly spent in labor, moving from place to place. On a whim, he stops riding to watch the "woods ll up with snow." During this brief moment, the narrator achieves spiritual transcendence and peace as he connects with nature.Throughout the poem, the narrator's horse is a symbol of daily labor and the constant struggle of civilization. Taken from the wilds of nature, domes- ticated, and trained to obey orders, the horse no longer has any apprecia- tion of nature. While the narrator relaxes in the woods, his horse "gives his harness bells a shake / To ask if there is some mistake." The irony here is that the man becomes even more connected to nature than the once-wild beast he rides.It's important that this event takes place during "The darkest evening of the year" because the darkness allows the narrator to be hidden from the civilized and unnatural world he lives in every day. At the same time, the darkness of the evening is ironic because the narrator can't really see the beauty of the woods very clearly. In this way, Frost suggests that nature's beauty is more than just visual. It's spiritual too. In the "lovely, dark and deep" woods, the narrator is able to fully appreciate the beauty of nature without seeing it.After his brief moment of peace, the narrator must return to the work- ing world. The line, "And miles to go before I sleep" is repeated at the end to show how weary and tired the narrator has become. Here, the "miles" represent long spans of time. He has a long time to wait before he gets home that night, and he also has a long time to wait before he reaches the ultimate sleep of death. But in this poem, the idea of death isn't negative because when the narrator dies, he will nally be permanently reunited with the beauty of nature.
Robert Frost's poem "Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening" can be interpreted as a man learning to appreciate nature.The poem starts out as a man in a horse-drawn carriage stops to appre- ciate the serenity of a dark, snowy evening. Although this might seem to be a simple poem using imagery, Frost sends a message about the power of nature. The man seems to enjoy the woods even more than his horse, who was probably born in the woods. It's a dark evening but somehow the man can still appreciate the lovely forest.166  At the end of the poem, Frost says that he can't stop to rest anymore because he has things to do. I thought this part was really sad because the man seemed so tired and didn't want to leave.This poem has many symbolic elements in it and I enjoyed this very much.
Roburt frost has made a poem about a snowy evening. In this essay I will explain about the message in the poem I have read.The poem is about a man who goes into a cold forest and stops to watch snow. I like to snowboard in the winter, so I know what he is felling. After- wards, frost says he cannot stop anymore because he has to go into town and help people. This is my intreputashun of his poem.

Although Americans move more than most people in the world, a move is acknowledged to be one of life's more stressful experiences. There are, how- ever, steps that can be taken and preparations that can be made which will mitigate the inevitable strain.If I were to move to a different city because of a job change, I would nd a sponsor in the new location, preferably someone who could give me insight into the kind of situation I could expect at the workplace and about the cultural and other differences in the new community. Different cities may be diverse in many ways: in ideas about appropriate behavior, in social expectations, and even in emotional reactions. If the city had special sites or events to generate civic pride, I would like to investigate those. Or there may be popular gathering places such as parks or cafs. This knowledge would be helpful in getting to understand the attitudes of the residents and to become part of the community.Spending time with a realtor would be a necessity, not only for nding a satisfactory residence, but also for gaining information about different neighborhoods, schools, libraries, and other community resources. In fact, it would be worthwhile to take the time to deliberately explore the com- munity by walking or driving around.My family members are interested in horses, sailing, and playing bridge. As a way to nd out how we can pursue these interests and nd people sim- ilarly inclined, we could visit stables, marinas, or social clubs. Striking up a conversation with people in these places and telling them that I am moving shortly would create a more knowledgeable transition. In addition to pick- ing the brains of people, there may be published material, such as maps and guidebooks, that could be informative. The same is true of Internet sites.All this preparation cannot eliminate the probability that leaving my friends, seeing my belongings picked up, packed, and moved to a different city, and facing new routines and new surroundings will be somewhat trau- matic. However, visualizing daily life in the new city can help make the move easier and the transition smoother.80  
If I nd out that I have to move to a different city I will try to make some plans. First of all I will have to nd a house. I will get a real estate person and look at houses. I will nd out how much they cost and if I can afford it. Then I will try to nd a nice area. The schools should be good and near the house and the church to.I like to play basketball and ride my bike and I will look around for places to play. Maybe I can meet some people who live there and make friends. Maybe they can show me around the place. I will try to meet someone who works at the new job. They can give me hints about how things are done there.I will say goodbye to my friends and give them my new address. It will be sad to move, but also there will be good things coming up. At least I wont be going in cold. I will have a place to live that is nice and I know maybe a few people already. I think I am starting to know what it will be like in my new home.
I have to move becuz my job it changed. I will go there to see what it is there. Is there a good house. I hate to pay for a house they always rip you off and the boss dosent car. I will nd our if the boss is good or not like this 1 I hate now. What can you do you want a job rite. I wil sell my house and use it to by the new 1 and I would learn the name of the new city and how to rite it.
