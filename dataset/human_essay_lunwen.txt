Introduction
As the matter of fact, every country has certain norms of the age of criminal responsibility. First and foremost, it should be highlighted that the major argument in support of the raising the age for the responsibility is that children are not mature, and brain development, social, and emotional factors only start to improve. The major purpose of the paper is to analyze three scenarios based on actual events from the point of view of the developmental characteristics of a child aged two-six and to highlight the significance of the implementation of the biological, cognitive, and emotional and social arguments to support the idea that children should not be responsible for crime actions.

The childhood is considered to be a very sensitive period in the development of the human being as it is the time when the brain shapes and it affects the development of emotions, concentration, ability to overcome stress, and have self-control (Berger, 2014). In the discussed scenarios, children cannot be responsible for the murder. Their brain chooses the option to eliminate the distraction moment (in the case, where a six-year-old girl murder her brother because he was constantly crying) or the person that caused conflict (in the first and second case, where children decided to kill the offender).
As the matter of fact, children usually imitate the actions of parents or something that they saw, for examples, in movies or video games (Berger, 2014). The immature brain cannot analyze or evaluate the consequences; it follows the model of the behavior that was previously seen in the mass media or experienced in some conversations (for example, in a fairy tale, when the bad person got killed for the happiness of the main hero).
Cognitive Argument

The theory of Piaget is centered on the peculiarities of the cognitive development and improvement of the intelligence (Berger, 2014). Children up to four years cannot analyze the information according to logic, whereas children up to six years use only primitive reasoning. The feeling of justice is highly developed in children. In the first case, the child shot the girl, because he was offended and thought that this way she will be punished. However, he did not understand the consequences and probably could not realize that shooting leads to death as the vast majority of children do not face death (of either family members or friends). They do not have the real understanding of what death is.

It should be stressed that the age of the criminal responsibility should be compared to the age when people can make individual choices. Teenagers are legally allowed to have sexual intercourse from the age of sixteen, can get married and vote after eighteen, and drink alcohol after twenty-one. The stated above can sometimes have the same dreadful consequences. Then the question arises, why should children be treated as criminals, when they are not allowed to make certain decisions as they considered to be immature. The child is not emotionally and socially developed (Berger, 2014). To make choices one should realize the consequences they might face. The child cannot control or distinguish emotions. It is the primary reason why the age of criminal responsibility should be raised.
In conclusion, it should be stressed that the stated above arguments, namely biological, cognitive, emotional, and social should be taken account. One of the most relevant thoughts is that the brain of the child is immature. Children lack logical reasoning, and that is, solve their problems in the way that is acceptable to them according to their personal experience. However, all the discussed above arguments should not be undervalued as they are significant and prove that the child should not be treated as the criminal.


Business in the contemporary times is characterized by stiff competition as each firm seeks to acquire a considerable market share in the local and the international market. Various factors have contributed to the stiffening competition including the desire to increase profitability and the evolution of the global market (Owoyemi et al. 2011). In that regard, firms have embarked in recruiting and retaining the best workers to achieve competitive advantage through increased quality of products or services produced by a competent workforce. Firms are today recruiting the best-qualified workers and paying them competitive salaries to retain them.

Some business analysts have however argued that hiring qualified employees and paying them competitive salaries is not the only way to motivate them. Employees need to be trained to handle new challenges in the changing business environment (Batool & Batool 2012). In that regard, most companies have introduced a set of training programs that aim at imparting skills to the workforce to enable them to handle their responsibilities more efficiently. The training programs so far adopted by major businesses target new employees through orientation programs. Most organizations tend to overlook the need to ensure continuous training of the workforce in their respective companies. Most managers are of the view that training should only apply to new staffs as opposed to the existing employees. The view is misguided since the current employees also need to be trained continuously if a firm is to achieve efficiency.

The orientation is important since it equips employees with the relevant information before the commencement of the work. Training of new employees in 5Ways Foodservices is poorly administered since it involves manual orientation from the experienced workers. New employees are assigned to experienced workers who take them through the orientation process. The employees are not advised of their roles in the organization before assignment of tasks. The orientation process takes long due to lack of a well-coordinated orientation programs. The wastage of time in the orientation stage translates into losses for the firm. The right orientation leads to increased efficiency since employees since every employee has adequate knowledge of their roles. Duplication of resources is avoided since the scope of each employee’s task is defined.

Training instills a sense of job security among workers since it enhances their dignity and job qualification. The feeling of job security instilled upon workers through training translates into high morale among the employees leading to achievement of the set goals (Puhakainen & Siponen 2010). Additionally, training reduces staff turnover in the sense that employees feel secure working in a firm that cares about their development needs. In 5Ways Foodservices, employees are poorly motivated due to lack of development opportunities leading to high staff turnover. The high staff turnover rate amongst the hotel’s workers has increased the operation cost owing to the high cost of recruiting new employees. Moreover, the quality of services in the hotel has been compromised since the firm loses its best employees to competitors. The competitors in the industry have training programs that attract workers with high skills. The rivals have continuous training programs that enhance a sense of job security among employees. The competitors absorb the high-skilled workers from 5Ways Foodservices hence heightening the competition.

Competition in the food service industry has stiffened in the past few decades prompting the need for training of the employees. In 5Ways Foodservices, employees’ training is overlooked, and only new staffs are trained on the basic of the organization culture when joining the firm. The new employee-training program is poorly managed, and it does not achieve the educational needs of the employees. The program centers on the orientation of the employees, and it is limited to the introduction of the employees to their new roles. No training is afforded to the employees after joining the firm, thus leading to reluctance from the employees in accepting changes. The evolution of the new technology has sparked the need to train employees continuously to prepare them to take new challenges. In 5Ways Foodservices, no such training is afforded to the employees leading to resistance to accepting changes in the organization.
The company’s mission is to provide the best quality services in the food and service industry. Therefore, to achieve this objective, employees need to be trained continuously to increase their efficiency. The training program should target both new and existing employees. The training program for the existing employees should focus on
1. Changes in the company’s strategies
2. New technologies
3. Good customer service

Employees who undergo the training should be highly remunerated or even promoted to higher positions in the firm. Better remuneration coupled with promotions will act as incentives to push employees to undergo such training. The training shall increase the efficiency of the firm and reduce staff turnover rates. Research indicates that firms that have continuous training programs in place are more efficient and profitable than firms that do not have such programs (Puhakainen & Siponen 2010). Such training will not only increase the firm’s efficiency, but it will also allow the employees to be innovative. It will also increase employees’ morale since it will impart a sense of job security among them.

An organization needs to have well-defined vision and missions for it to be successful against the backdrop of the stiffening competition among firms operating in the food service industry. Employees need to be involved in major decisions of a firm. Involving employees in the decision-making process of a firm not only motivates them but also instills a sense of ownership in them. Employees tend to work hard to achieve targets they have set for themselves. In 5Ways Foodservice, decision-making is an exclusive role of the management and employees’ inputs are not allowed. Communication is top-down whereby the top managers communicate decisions to the staff. Little training is done to the employees regarding the decisions coupled with how to implement them in the organization. This aspect leads to mistakes during implementation causing inefficiencies and losses.
The orientation of workers is an important process of the recruitment process and involves defining the scope of work for the employee. New employees need to be introduced to the new work environment. The company should develop a new staff-training program that will consider the learning needs of the new employees. Under the program, the new workers should be trained in the following areas:
1. Definition of the scope of work
2. Introduction to the company’s cooperate culture
A performance management system refers to the strategic approach adopted by a firm to increase the efficiency of its workers and improve the achievement of the set goals. Performance appraisals are important since they guide promotional decisions. The best performing employees are promoted to higher positions in the firm. Promotions based on merit increase the workers morale and encourage the other workers to work hard to obtain such promotions (Ferreira & Otley 2009).
</text>
<text>
The 5 Ways Foodservices’ performance appraisal system is below average since workers’ performance is measured manually. Organizations need to have sound job performance appraisal systems to assess the work of every individual worker. In 5Ways Foodservices, the importance of job performance appraisal is overlooked with individual worker’s performance being measured manually. The managers utilize observation to assess the performance of the worker. Lack of job performance measuring tools leads to low motivation among the workforce. In companies with sound job performance appraisal systems, each worker’s performance is measured against the targets set (Folan & Browne 2005). The best performing workers are acknowledged in some cases publicized. In such organizations, promotions are done through merit whereby the best performing workers hold powerful positions in the organization. Promoting employees based on merit increases morale and it encourages them to work hard to achieve the set targets. 5Ways Foodservices lacks a formal job performance appraisal system, and the employees performance is only based on the managers’ view of a certain employee. Managers may be biased when making such assessments leading to promotion of the inappropriate employees. This aspect may contribute to low morale among the workforce and increase staff turnover.

Due to the adverse effects caused by lack of a formal performance appraisal system, this paper shall propose a performance appraisal system for the 5Ways Foodservices hotel to improve performance. Currently, the company lacks a formal performance management system to measure the performance of workers. In 5Ways Foodservices, the supervisors assess the workers’ performance and the performance reports are based on the supervisor’s opinion. Managers may be biased when making such assessments leading to promotion of the inappropriate workers. This aspect may adversely affect the morale of the workers affecting the achievement of the set objectives.

<text>
Performance appraisals are important to an organization since it allows the management to assess the performance of the individual workers. It also allows managers to set achievable targets for individual employees based on their ability and skills. The set targets are reviewed at different stages of achievement and deviations from the set standards are explained. This aspect leads to the high performance of the firm since the targets must be achieved at all cost. For a firm to achieve its missions it has to set its targets in advance and communicate the same to the employees. The achievement of the targets depends on the performance appraisal system adopted by the firm.
Lack of a proper performance measurement system is closely linked to high staff turnover in most organizations. The absence of a performance appraisal system leads to low morale among employees leading to poor achievement of the firm’s objectives. Employees tend to be more concerned about their job security as compared to other aspects. Since low motivation among employees leads to poor performance by the firm, workers tend to seek jobs in rival companies to be assured of job security.
Employees need to be assured of their job security to motivate them to perform their duties effectively. Employees tend to prefer working in a well-performing firm to a poorly performing one (Ferreira & Otley 2009. In that regard, employees of 5Ways Foodservices tend to leave the firm to be absorbed by the competitors who are performing better as compared to the firm in question. This aspect leads to a high turnover rate for the firm. The profitability of the firm is affected by such high turnover rates since recruiting new employees increases the operating costs.

<text>
The performance management system should be devised in such a way that it integrates various incentives to motivate employees to work industriously towards achieving the set targets. The incentives should come in the form of promotions for the best-performing employees, publicity for god performance, bonuses. The system should be accommodative so that employees are involved in setting the targets. The system should be designed in such a way that it allows for the assessment of both individual and group performances. This aspect will encourage teamwork, and it will facilitate the achievement of the set goals. Employees tend to be more motivated working on goals they have set for themselves than when such targets are imposed by the management (Folan & Browne 2005). The incentives should be structured to fit both individual and groups within the organization. This move will boost the workers morale leading to the achievement of the set goals. Currently, the organization has no incentives in place to boost the morale of the employees. The work of an individual worker cannot be differentiated from group work, thus leading to low morale among the employees.


Businesses are established with an aim of profit maximization. There are several businesses in the global economy, which leads to intense competition in the market. There are different functions of management that must be effectively coordinated towards the achievement of the goals and objectives of an organization. Marketing is the process of informing consumers of new and existing products, how to use the respective products, changes made in production and/or prices among others. Marketing is a process that all organizations, both profit and non-profit, must consider when analyzing and determining the consumer needs due to t dynamic nature of the last. Different authors have different views on global marketing aspects such as planning, increasing sales, and business growth among others. This is a critical analysis of three articles in support of and against the marketing contents of the respective articles.

The article, “10 Steps of getting started with social media marketing” by Susan Gunelius discusses how to use social media towards developing a global business effectively. The author recommends 10 basic steps that individual businesses should consider when using social media as a marketing tool to succeed. The basic steps recommended by the author are determining the goals, evaluating resources, adequate knowledge of the audience, creating amazing content, integrating marketing efforts, creating a schedule, adopting an 80-20 rule, focusing more on quality, giving up control, and keep learning. Furthermore, the author discusses each step and how to implement them towards effective marketing (Gunelius 1).

Personally I, as a marketing student, support the contents of the article and the arguments of the author due to several reasons, for instance, effective application of the Strength Weakness Opportunity Threat analysis. The 10 steps proposed by the author on how to get started with social media marketing incorporate the SWOT analysis because it involves an analysis of the strengths of an organization, its weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Social media marketing is a marketing plan. Business organizations must develop effective strategies when implementing a marketing plan to succeed. The 10 steps discussed by the author can be used in the effective implementation of social media marketing. Therefore, I support the contents of the article and the arguments by the author (Gunelius 1).

The article, “10 Ways to stretch your marketing budget” by Robert W. Bly discusses useful strategies that organizations can utilize to maximize their campaigns while saving money. The author proposes 10 ways that business organizations can use to ensure accountability of every dollar, and get big results despite small budgets. The author proposes sticking to successful strategies, exploring lead generations, doing things by ourself, and paying vendors on time among others. The author has proposed effective strategies for saving money and accounting for every dollar. However, not all the steps proposed by the author are relevant to global marketing (Bly 1).

War periods present a trying time for humankind. War is known to highlight the worst qualities of humankind. During wars, people turn against each other as their moral integrity is compromised. In his book “A Darkling Plain”, Dr. Kristen Monroe investigates how conflict affects humanity. Monroe is a philosophy and political science professor at the University of California at Irvine. Monroe’s book uses stories from people who lived through wars and later witnessed flourishing happiness. These narratives form the basis of the book “A Darkling Plain” and they include interviews with people who survived international and civil conflicts. The interviewed people include soldiers, victims of dictatorial regimes, and refugees. According to the author’s narrative, it is hard for anyone to survive the war with his/her personality intact. Monroe presents the argument that war has profound effects on psychological processes. Moreover, the book is subdivided into six psychological dimensions for easier analysis. This paper explains how Monroe uses narrative analysis to evaluate the issues of humanity and war.

“A Darkling Plain” is made up of a series of analyses that span over different periods and continents. These narratives reflect peoples’ attempts at making sense of their reality. Normally, narratives are used to present shared beliefs, similar identities, and common origins. In Monroe’s case, narratives are used to present similar experiences. Most of the interviewed persons have either survived a war or experienced the effects of the war firsthand. For instance, some of the narratives cover wars that happened in the early 1920s while the others cover conflicts that happened in this century. However, all these narratives reveal similarities in inexperience. For example, the story of Frank the South Pacific soldier details war-related experiences in the early 1920s. Nevertheless, Frank’s experiences bear striking similarities with those of displaced African refugees. Therefore, the author is able to create a network of ideas that help to highlight how war affects humanity.

Monroe’s style of narrative analysis is quite wholesome as compared to other narrative styles. Most narratives tend to omit the details that are considered to be of less importance. However, Monroe’s narratives are inclusive of all the details that the narrators consider important to them. In some instances, the narratives used in “A Darkling Plain” tend to contain ‘irrelevant’ information. Nevertheless, the wholesome nature of Monroe’s narrative style enriches the quality of her work and adds authenticity to the narrators’ experiences. The narrators are allowed to offer all details of their life during the war period. Significantly, the core aspects of these narrations converge to show how humanity reacts to war experiences.

The author’s conclusions about the war are quite accurate. The narratives used in the book only give the version of the story that the narrator wants to be known. Some narrators do not want their readers/listeners to know how bad the war was. For example, Frank the Soldier jokes about the experiences of his life during the war in a bid to cover up the horrible experiences of the war. On the other hand, other narrators do their best to convey the horrors of the war to their audiences. In Ngugi Wa Thiongo’s narrative, he highlights the bloodiest war experiences such as the beheading of the man who would not part with his Bible (Monroe 46). Another situation where the narrative analysis would be necessary is when trying to find reconciliation.

According to Monroe, people use several tactics to ensure that they maintain their humanity during the war. The author claims most survivors view humanity as a threefold concept that covers all human beings, the quality of humanity, and the ability to be humane by treating others with care and concern. Therefore, Monroe argues that maintaining humanity “includes the ability to retain the decency that is part of our human condition, to show respect and concern for others, and to demonstrate kindness and benevolence in our treatment of our fellow human beings, even during the war” (Monroe 25). However, the author notes that narrators do not necessarily focus on the aspect of ‘retaining humanity’ in their narrations. It is noted that some people retain their humanity by sharing and memorizing wartime stories. Other people retain their humanity by repressing and trying to forget the experiences of the war. Most of the people who try to forget their war experiences reckon that it is almost impossible to remain human while one is still carrying around the experiences of the war. One of the narrators in Monroe’s book claims that the fact that she was able to love even when she was held up in a concentration camp helped her maintain her humanity. Maintaining humanity could also be motivated by peoples’ service to others. For instance, Monroe notes that some victims struggled to survive for the sake of their families.

That said, I got wondering who was acting right and/or wrong in the pub, in other words, how should drunken people act? I guess there can’t be a conclusive answer to this. As alluded to above, the individual chooses how to respond to expectations and plays along or defy. The quiet customers ‘either accepted or refused’ to abide by expectations; the ‘noisy drunk’ as well. What this reflects is that the influence of the environment is not a simplistic one. There is always an interplay of factors that mould ‘that’ environment, in the end, what conforming or deviance in a bar really means cannot be conclusively decided.
Word Choices in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” by William Shakespeare Essay
The dark night that from the eye his function takes,
The ear quicker of apprehension makes;
Wherein in doth impair the seeing sense,
It pays the hearing double recompense.
Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;
Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound.
But why unkindly didst thou leave me so? (Shakespeare 52)
This passage dwells upon the human senses at night. It is obvious that people cannot see enough at this particular time, at night. The author has chosen the specific words for describing human feelings, thus, describing the simple blindness because of the dark time, the author refers to specific scientific terminology, “function” and “response.” These words are more appropriate for the discussion of the research, but not the senses. The choice of these words may be explained by the desire to show that human senses are particular processes which require adequate treatment.

<text>
Further, the author refers to the possibilities of better hearing but worse look as to the art. It seems that the author wants to find an explanation for the process of change. When night comes, people suffer from impairing the seeing sense and the doubling of the hearing. Calling this an art, the author wants to show how much miracle is there in the human body. The word art is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as “a human creative skill or its application” (n.p.). Thus, the author wants to show that art is not just the things people create but also the skills they possess. Moreover, the Oxford English Dictionary refers to the word “art” to “mystery,” which is exactly the case in this passage.
The chapter under consideration deals with the Bolsheviks’ expansion, which shaped the development of the relations between the countries of the Middle East and Russia. It is important to note that though Lenin claimed it was important for nations to become independent, Bolsheviks made everything to re-conquer eastern territories. This Bolsheviks’ imperialistic policy made natives of the eastern territories develop strong hostility to the Russians.

Interestingly, Bolsheviks claimed that the power of the proletariat is the most humanness order to build. They also promised to help nations conquered by the czar’s regime to regain their freedom. At the same time, Lenin claimed that the East did not have the working class to help the peasantry to build a democratic and just society. Lenin also stated that “[i]n effect this meant that the peoples of the East were not yet ready to exercise their right to be free” (Fromkin 476). At that, Stalin believed the nations should be subordinate to the central power, i.e., the power of Moscow. Basically, the short-term goals of the two leaders were similar.

During his tenure at his first job, he was concerned with the improvement of service delivery to his dear clients, regarding the needs of customers to be paramount in urgency to any of the other matters. Thus, with regards to Herzberg’s theory of motivation, better working conditions and exemplary interpersonal relations had to be established. Believing in spearheading the revolution of seeing the company grow to a giant, he was tasked with the responsibility of making its dreams become realized in the shortest time possible. With his past achievements and increased responsibilities, he tactfully enacted a policy that not only increased the company’s sales but also its customers.
The need for job independence and the pursuit of passion, which is direct to expectancy theory of motivation, was one of the pillars towards the creation of the security firm in which he currently holds the position of Chief Executive Officer. The amount of effort he had been inputting in the realization of his goals required a satisfactory level of performance. Regardless of whether the choices he had taken were realistic, achievable, or not, he aimed at being the best by getting the approval of the people and working towards nothing less than achieving the vision of the firm.
According to Porters and Lawler’s models, his achievements, passion, and the rewards that awaited him superseded the losses and the embarrassment he was to get if his firm failed. Motivated by realistic goals and moved by job independence, he was always focused on achieving the firm’s goals. Thus by him and his staff putting the correct amount of effort in the daily service delivery to clients, and also conducting surveys on the acceptability of the firm in society, they built a strong pillar towards the achievement of his dreams as an individual.
In a greater sense majorly focusing on my uncle’s achievements about the motivational theories, which were and are still realistic, I will always find him to be the spring of all my motivation. Regarding him as a mentor, and I as the protégé, my success in life will always be coined around his hard work.
A Survey of the Old Testament Essay
The command to be fruitful and multiply was given to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. God wanted man and woman to reproduce and fill the earth with humanity. However, God’s plan was that the earth would be filled with people who lived in righteousness. The world was to be filled with people in the same spiritual condition as that of Adam and Eve before their fall. However, sin entered the world. Therefore, the multiplication of people led to the multiplication of their sins.
</text>

One example of how this population increase led to an increase in sin was during the time when the tower of Babel was being built. The people came together, determined to build a tower that would reach the heavens. They claimed that, in building this tower, they would not be scattered all over the earth. Instead, they would build a name for themselves in that single place. This, of course, was in direct contradiction to God’s plan that people should multiply and spread throughout all the earth. This is why God confused their languages and caused chaos that ended up halting the building project (Dillard and Tremper 55).
The second instance was when Pharaoh tried to destroy the Hebrew male babies. Pharaoh had noticed that the Israelite slaves were rapidly growing both in numbers and might. Afraid that they would take over the rulership of Egypt, he ordered that all the male newborn babies be killed. His plan was to prevent the Israelites from multiplying. This was in direct contradiction to God’s initial command. Therefore, in an effort to preserve His covenant people, God saved the life of Moses. Moses would later grow up to be the liberator of the Israelite people from their bondage in Egypt.

Initially, it was not God’s desire that the Israelites be ruled by Kings. But God knew that they would demand a king, and He set provisions in the law for a king. There were very high responsibilities that God set for the kings in order to set an example for the people. For example, through King David, God demanded that the King be accountable and a person of unquestionable character. This was clearly brought out when he sinned by committing adultery with Bathsheba and tried to hide his sins. God sent the Prophet Nathan to deal with the issue. This was a lesson to the people that not even kings were above God’s law.
Through King Solomon, the people learned the responsibilities of a king in ensuring that people worshiped the one true God. Solomon had the responsibility of building God’s temple according to the specifications that God himself had given. The king was thus supposed to display an attitude of service and total submission and obedience to God, setting an example for all (Williams and Stanley 501).

King Uziah was a king of Judah. He was a great warrior and is remembered for the many fortifications he put around Judah. However, he grew proud and corrupt. He also defiled the temple and sinned before God when he went to burn incense upon the altar. This showed that even kings were to adhere to God’s law and could not overrule the role of the high priest. They had to obey and live by the law, just like everyone else. God punished Uziah by striking him with leprosy. Throughout the history of Israel and Judah, God displayed His high standards and expectations for the kings. The kings served as a lesson to the people when God rewarded their obedience and punished their disobedience.
Worship refers to the different attitudes of service, submission, and reverence towards God. In other words, it refers to the obedience of God, keeping His commands, and pleasing Him. The author of the above statement is right in terming worship as a dangerous thing. This is because man’s nature is fallen, and he is, therefore, incapable of exhibiting the perfection that God demands. For a man to truly worship God, he must display perfect obedience.
Since this is not possible due to sin, there are sacrifices that must be made to atone for man’s failings. These sacrifices also have to be made in accordance with God’s requirements. Failure to meet any one of the requirement puts the person’s own life in danger.

In the Old Testament, people worshipped God by keeping the commandments given through Moses. Failure to keep any of the many laws required sacrifices to be made. There were also many other sacrifices that had to be made at certain times and in a certain specific way. The people who failed in one way or another were either stricken by a horrible disease, or they were killed (Arnold and Bryan 46). This clearly shows just how dangerous true worship was. A pure and perfect God demands the same of us. However, humanity is made up of imperfect and sinful people. Also, since God is just, He must punish our failings. This is what makes worship dangerous, especially in the Old Testament. However, in the New Testament, Jesus bore these punishments and justified believers.

Adam Smith and David Ricardo had a significant influence on the perception of international trade by developing their theories of absolute and comparative advantage. These approaches have long affected economic relations and dictated the rules of play. Nevertheless, as time passed, other theorists started to argue the foundations of these theories, such as complete employment, free trade, and global allocations of products manufactured on a country basis without the existence and interference of multinational enterprises. These questions were investigated by many scholars from all over the globe.

To begin with, Adam Smith’s theory of absolute advantage is the foundation of Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage. The latter was given preference because it is believed that Smith’s theory is not applicable to the real world. However, according to Schumacher (2012a), this belief is based on excerpts from Smith’s theory instead of his original work. Based on this assumption, the author claims that the theory of absolute advantage is still relevant in the modern world due to the fact that some concepts such as specialization and economy of scale were mentioned in his original work – The Wealth of Nations, but ignored in textbooks.
Moreover, Smith should be appraised for his dynamic approach to perceiving production and technological change, which derive from the alterations of the global economic environment and international trade. The overall conclusion of the whole paper is the following: a dynamic theory of absolute advantage cannot be seen as the basis of Ricardo’s static theory of comparative advantage.

The whole of this case circles around the access right and entitlement to money or money’s worth. The investigation on the theft of the sculpture is, therefore, centered on the money and money’s worth. In this case, there are numerous parties with a vested interest in the value and valuation of the stolen item. To be able to narrow down the number of suspects and possibly identify the persons responsible for the theft, the highest beneficiaries to the theft must be singled out. Fundamentally, it is insured for 3.5 million. It is apparent that there were several past indications to forgeries, and therefore its validity and originality could, therefore, up the market price that a buyer will be willing to part with.
Among the suspects, there are those in dire need of the money due to financial problems, while others need the values worth of the item and not the actual monetary price attached to the item. These two prospects must be clearly distinguished and conceived as interdependent yet still different in the investigation. Who stole?
The item was stolen by Hector Peters and with the aid of Bridget Perkins and Lucien Higginbotham. The motive of the theft is money or money’s worth. All these parties are motivated by either of the two motives. They are also best described as spending enough time in the kitchen which offers an easy view of the conservatory. They also spend enough time in the kitchen discussing the foundation.
Why they stole?
</text>
<text>
Hector Peters has a history with Dr Felix and therefore understands her properly including the affairs of the foundation and its imminent future. He is aware that the foundation is undergoing serious financial concerns and therefore on disclosure of this information it becomes apparent that they need an urgent source of income. Hectors has experience in art selling and is aware that the sculpture is an original and is probably worth a lot of money. The publication of the story of the art seller who was facing art forgery allegations provided an opportunity for him and his new girlfriend to take advantage of Lucien unfortunate eventuality and loss.
He approached the gallery owner who is supposedly his former silent partner as described in Dorian’s book and they develop the scheme to acquire the original sculpture form the foundation Acquisition of the sculpture would allow them to recover the losses and restore their reputation as an art gallery. As Hawksblood records “I’m over three million dollars over this mess” It would also provide an opportunity to increase the value of the sculpture as its originality gave it a better outlook in the face of fakes and the rising popularity of similar pieces by Diva Goldsmith(Hawksblood 99).
How they stole?
The strategy taken by the three suspects is to penetrate the foundation and earn the trust and confidence of its members and administrators. Hector Peters makes his legitimate entrance to the foundation and gains the trust and confidence of its public relations officer Bridget Perkins. That way he was able to control the content and information released to the public and also makes an input in the press releases made.
Over this period, he had enough time and opportunity to plan and devise the robbery. On the night of the robbery, Peters and Perkins created a strategic distraction for the journalist and researcher who had in earlier years exposed the frauds that were perpetrated by a young gallery owner who was now befriending Dr Felix who was suffering from the overwhelming responsibilities of the foundation and the financial problems facing the foundation.
He assumed the identity of an artist taking interest in the collections to get closer to Dr Felix. Peters and his girlfriend maintained an observant eye on the conservatory and made sure that they led the journalist out of the kitchen just in time for Lucien Higginbotham to enter through the kitchen to falsely alarm Peters and Perkins and who still continue to occupy the journalist to ensure that Dorian remains engaged. Peters and Perkins proceed to the conservatory room after having dismissed Dorian out to get the phone and call the police.

<text>
All this is stage managed to ensure that the call from the police is made by Dr Felix’s children before Dorian could make the call because he was sent outside through the front. The kitchen and the conservatory are rather closely adjacent in the landscape setting therefore it would be possible at least to hear the sound of shattered glass all the way from the kitchen if at all Peters and Perkins were in the kitchen. They would have ably heard of the breaking but it is recorded that they. It is therefore clear they were aware of the breaking and were hiding the fact that it had actually happened under their supervision.
All along Lucien had taken the advantage of the private viewing session to leave the back window open which he used to get into the conservatory and quickly steal the sculpture and head out to the front after hiding it and going through the front window explaining the open front and back windows. All these were facilitated by the assistance of Peters and Perkins.

Accounting Standards and Effects Report

Standards are imperative in determination of network value if they entirely rely on size. Given that PSGT is a large corporation with capability to expand to global markets; it is likely that its network will be extremely wide. Owing to the fact that large corporations choose independence or prefer diversity in service provision, adoption of standards is sometimes considered to be less important.
</text>
<text>
For instance, the decisions by technology giants such as Microsoft and America online to neglect standardization in their networking practices have positively impacted their growths on a global scale. This does not however leave an absolute implication that standardization is redundant in corporation success since its adoption can greatly influence company result s in a positive way. The latter explains why consideration and adoption of standards will be important for strategic growth of PSGT Intel Co. According to Varian, PSGT adoption of standards would greatly determine its value according to the equation PSGT Value = PSGT Share x Total industry value (Varian 240).
From this equation, it is evident that market share becomes a determinant force in PSGT value. Thus, with an understanding that the value of PSGT will entirely depend on the size of VIS market industry, strategies to implement standards have been laid down. But before standard formation, it is imperative that specific aspect factors be taken into consideration. These will have to be far in mind emerging factors such as negotiation, wars and leadership in regards to standards and standard adoption (Birchler & Butler 45).
Strategic market acquisition is very important for a company’s wellbeing. In this perspective, PSGT understands that market rivalry is absolutely inevitable. Additionally, earlier preparation for future control of marketing is one of the strategies that PSGT Intel Co. Ltd has committed itself in order to manage future markets through employment of various tactics. For instance, price management through determination and change either in the present and or the future will be solely a PSGT exercise. This will be aimed at overcoming industry rivals and thus acquiring a bigger market share.
Secondly, This Company has put in place management strategies that seek to employ marketing domination tactics such as market share bragging. It has also committed itself towards lowering its future prices of products with an intention of overtaking its competitors. Lastly, there have been negotiations with companies such as nuance and McIntosh to make an alliance that would ensure market stability in regards to voice recognition technologies.
Standard negotiations

Accounting is a critical aspect of any organization since it is responsible for computational results that draw organizational image (Birchler & Butler 130). Transaction occurrences at PSGT would be unavoidable and as such, the responsibility of mediation has been arrived at. Information provided by the accounting unit of any organization is importance in reflection and determination of company’s future. With presence of record keeping technologies such as those present in Blockbuster and the spread of Electronic vehicle management system have greatly influenced accounting systems of companies in the technology industry.
Their adoption would lead to lowering of accounting monitoring costs such as finance and time thus leading to higher levels of efficiency in production. With this perspective in the vision of PSGT Intel Co. Ltd, it is estimated that the company will be experienced a consistent annual growth of more than 40% for the following decade. Our current income statement and balance sheet would provide figures as shown below:

Action Research and Educational Program Evaluation Essay
The topics that are best approached through action research

It should be noted that action research is particularly applicable to specific questions that can be related to the quality of programs, instruction methods, or textbooks. As a rule, educators choose this technique when they need to address a specific educational problem arising in a certain setting. In most cases, these topics are related to the classroom activities of students and teachers. Overall, scholars argue that action research applies to so-called local-level settings (Mertler & Charles, 2011). For instance, a teacher can apply this technique to understand what kind of difficulties students face when they do certain tasks such as mathematical problems.

Moreover, in this way, the educator will attempt to design strategies that can help learners avoid these difficulties. This is the main task of the action research. In this case, the teacher will also participate in this activity, and he/she can modify the instruction strategy used during the class. One should mention that action research is more suitable to the topics that can be formulated as an open-ended question. In particular, a teacher can apply this model to identify methods that can facilitate learners’ understanding of the new material (Baumfield, Hall, & Wall, 2010). It is possible to argue that the topics examined through action research are not related to large population groups. This is one of the main aspects that can be identified. They should be taken into account by educators and other professionals who can undertake action research.

The target market demographics for the extended warranty will primarily be high income clients of Store A These individuals should have excellent credit scores of 600 and above while at the same time show consistent patronage of some of Abu Dhabi’s most prestigious and high end establishments. It is assumed, though not entirely confirmed, that 60 to 70 percent of the clientele that match the specified requirements will be female clients of the store (since they are the ones who do most of the shopping for households within the region) while the remaining 40 or 30 percent will be male. This is based upon consumer market surveys which examined the prevalence of female shoppers at high end department stores as compared to male consumers.
Behavior Factors
Specific behavioral factors that should be present are: high and occasional purchases of expensive brand name household goods and electronics, little variation in purchasing location (i.e. continuous patronage of the same high end stores), and finally little or no delinquency in paying for purchases made.
Market Needs
The market need in this particular case is that consumers needs an extended warranty service that links specifically to the store where they do the most shopping and, as such, enables them to derive the most benefit from shopping at their favorite location through an extended warranty service that enables them to make the most of their household and electronic purchases.
Market Trends
One of the current marketing trends in the retail industry has been to connect special amenities, services and exclusive offers to particular products. This is done in order to increase consumer patronage within a select number of stores given the better value they obtain from patronizing such establishments. Thus, for the commercial services department to establish an extended marketing division would result in greater consumer patronage of the store since that people are always out to get the most value for the amount they pay.
Target Market Growth
It is anticipated that the target market growth for the extended warranty will be a 10 to 15 percent client base increase per year until full market saturation levels are reached and by that time target market growth will be reduced to 5 to 7 percent annually.
SWOT Analysis (both the new product and Bank of America)
Strengths
One factor to take into consideration is the fact that the extended warranty and its ability to be connected to specific departments within the store for better discounts and services is an option not entirely available with other stores in Abu Dhabi or the U.A.E. The Extended warranty due to its store specific availability gives consumers a far better and wider variety of amenities and services not otherwise available with other retailers and, as such, presents itself as lucrative option for discerning clients.

One of the current weaknesses that extended warranty division has to deal with is the current economic downturn that has affected the U.S. While it may be true that the banks and several corporations have somewhat recovered from the 2008 financial crisis, the fact still remains that there is still a lingering financial problem with the current economy. With the debt crisis in Europe having the potential to spread to Middle East the next few months can actually be considered a tumultuous experience for the region. Consumers may be unwilling to spend more on their purchases which would result in the extended warranty division being nothing more than a wasteful and useless expenditure.

While numerous financial reports within the past few months have indicated that the U.A.E job market has not improved by much, they do indicate that corporate profits have increased. One underlying reason behind this can be attributed to the subsequent increase in outsourcing wherein companies have shifted several aspects of their operations to overseas locations due to the cheaper labor cost. This is important to point out due to the fact that as corporate profits increase so to do the incomes of the upper 1 to 10 percent consumer demographic. It should also be noted that the outsourcing of specific facets of the extended warranty service such as the document processing aspect of the division can be done which can help to greatly reduce the costs needed to continue to run the division. It is based on this that it is recommended that the extended warranty division outsource aspects of its services in order to save money in the long run.

In order to determine how well the company was able to meet its market objectives sufficient market research will need to be conducted. First and foremost it will be necessary to examine after six months time whether the company was able to increase the extended warranty purchase of its target clients. After which an examination will be necessary to see how many current subscribers there are in the extended warranty program versus the number of estimated credit card users of the targeted demographic within Abu Dhabi. After combing both data sets it will be possible to see the degree of market penetration, the degree of usage and whether the company was able to meet its market objectives.

Since the basic project outline has now been established it now becomes necessary to determine the overall composition of the team and how it should be organized. One method of organization that could be potentially utilized is the vertical approach, more commonly known as the “top down approach”, wherein a strict hierarchy is established with orders coming from the team leader getting passed to the appropriate team member resulting in that individual accomplishing the task given to them. Blackstone, Cox & Schleier (2009) indicates that while such an approach in managing a technology intensive company allows greater control over the process of task delegation and compliance to an established plan they state that it limits the ability of a project to effectively respond to changing market forces and actually limits the ability of the project team to effectively respond to changes within a business environment (Blackstone, Cox & Schleier, 2009).

What must be understood is that technology oriented businesses do not operate within a vacuum, rather they operate within a constantly changing and shifting environment where new innovations technologies effectively necessitate the need to change project strategies on an almost yearly basis (Thamhain, 2005). Taking this into consideration a more effect approach to be utilized is the horizontal approach wherein each member is given the freedom to contribute ideas, process and implement their own unique methods in getting a specific task accomplished. It is due to this that in the case of Plant Source the recommended project team composition should utilize the horizontal approach in order to help facilitate a more effective sharing of idea and the utilization of innovate processes in order to get the job done.

As mentioned earlier creating effective client relations is an important aspect of the company since the division needs a buyer for its products.. As such it becomes necessary to utilize business to business sales with corporations such as Shell, Exxon Mobile and Petron in order to for the company to actually get its products out there. It is due to this that one division of the project team for this particular venture needs to deal with establishing business agreements with other corporations in order to facilitate the sale of division’s extended warranty whenever these companies/consumers buy their products directly from Store A. In fact this particular aspect of operations can be considered the most important since without it the project won’t become viable at all.

One aspect of the project team must deal with developing proper agreements with local repair outlets in regions identified as viable locations for consumers to get to in order to have their product repaired. The reason why a liaison group is necessary is due to the fact that proper agreements need to be created with local repair shops in which they agree to change their current method of production to one that is more inclined towards the needs of the company. Since this at times puts repair shops at risk this necessitates the need for constant reassurances, proper guidance as well as local site teams that will initially assist the repair shops in developing the necessary systems and training for the repair of particular items.
Other aspects that the liaison team will have to deal with involves having to create an appropriate technological system where repair limitations, transportation systems as well as seed supplies need to be systematized, catalogued and distributed depending on the inherent need per repair shop. Furthermore, the liaison team will be responsible in determining how much work a certain repair shop can accomplish within a given area and determine how this will impact company production. This can either involve them scaling backing or increasing repair sites within particular regional areas.

One of the necessary aspects of proper project management is to ensure that there is an adequate level of product development within the project team (Lenfle & Loch, 2010).This particular aspect of operations involves the team setting up the necessary warehouses, repair men and repair shops however it must also be noted that this aspect of the project team does not just involve setting up the technology and supervising product quality but it also involves having to examine the current technological environment to see if there are any emerging technologies that can be utilized in the repair process.
Product development also involves taking the initial product and seeing if it can be improved beyond its original capacities through the use of new technologies.
Response to Changing Technological Environment
</text>
<text>
One of the measures of a successful project by a technology intensive company is how the project reacts to sudden changes in the global market (Thamhain, 2005). What must be understood is that a project timeline can last from weeks, to months and even up to several years. Within this span of time numerous changes can and will occur which may affect the viability of a particular project. One example of this can be seen in the case of the Playstation 3 produced by Sony and the Wii created by Nintendo. While both units were released at roughly the same span of time; sales of the Nintendo Wii eclipsed that of the Playstation 3 due to the innovative concept of a motion controller and the greater degree of person-to-console interactivity that the Wii was able to provide to gamers. Sony on the other hand had banked on the performance and graphics that the Playstation 3 could provide however as seen by the initial sales results of the company the unit was considered far too expensive with fewer game titles available as compared to the Wii which was much cheaper and had a plethora of titles to choose from. It was only when Sony dropped the price of the Playstation 3 by several hundred dollars a year later that the company was able to gain sufficient traction within the gaming community. Based on this case alone it can be seen that companies need to be able to respond to changing technologies which may affect their market shares
(Baydoun, 2010).Some possible technological developments that may arise which could cause problems for the company in the form of better extended warranties developed by rival corporations or even changing consumer preferences from extended warranties to normal warranties.

The response of the project team to sudden changes in the technological environment that it finds itself in is a measure of how well the current project they are undertaking will succeed. A slow response as seen in the case of Sony can result in rivals capturing a greater market share or even completely capturing the market as seen in the case of the Microsoft Zoon and the iPhone. Thus, when evaluating the project team their response to technological innovations will come in the form of determining how fast they were able to respond to the change, how did they change their business strategy, what processes did they implement to minimize the negative effects on the project and to what extent did they facilitate their own responses to the changes that occurred (Killough & Sheely, 2011).

All projects are subject to a certain lifecycle as indicated by the inherent limitations of the project itself and as such it becomes important to determine whether the team either contributed towards meeting deadline objectives, going over the deadline or even completing the project earlier than expected (Howes, 2001). As examined by Thamhain (2005), technology based projects need to conform to set resource and time limits from creation to completion (Thamlain, 2005). Project teams that expend more resources and time than what is legitimately necessary can thus be categorized as inefficient and negligent since it is their responsibility to ensure that projects are able to stay within set limits.

Profit and non-profit organizations have grown beyond geographical boundaries and have exceeded the confinements of local laws and regulations. There is a need for standards that will apply to all agencies globally, particularly those that govern the treatment of humans, be it, workers or clients. Consequently, the United Nations (UN), with the help of the Human Rights Council (2005), has been at the forefront championing human rights and developing universal policies to support the same. Governments, businesses, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have the sole responsibility of adhering to such regulations meant to respect humans and how they are treated.

Societies have become concerned about how organizational activities affect human rights. All stakeholders, including investors, governments, workers, and clients, expect agencies to prioritize human rights in all company operations. For most institutions, it is a challenge because there are gaps within national regulations that do not consider related vices. As a result, organizations have committed themselves voluntarily to UN stipulations and related documents such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) in developing company policies and codes of conduct. St. Johns Riverside Hospital (SJRH) is a company located in Westchester County, New York State, which values all humans’ freedoms and privileges. The agency has one primary hospital and four other secondary facilities within the state that operate under the same management.

The mission of St. Johns Riverside Hospital is to provide extensive nursing and medical services in a professional, ethical, compassionate, and respectful manner to all patients. Regardless of a client’s background or condition, the hospital endeavors to give equal and high-quality care. Additionally, all employees are expected to follow the company’s code of conduct while attending to them. The organization offers brilliance in nursing and medical care, preventive services, state-of-the-art technologies, and continuing education (St. Johns Riverside Hospital, 2020). Furthermore, SJRH strives to improve its services in all its branches and to impact the general quality of life in the neighboring communities. In conducting its mission, the hospital encourages initiatives and new ideas from the staff members and outsiders.

The agency has a set of services divided and accomplished in two primary departments. Behavioral Health Services department is the first one and is meant to help addicts achieve sobriety by attending to their mental struggles and teaching them self-care practices. These services are availed in four distinct locations within Westchester. The main one is Greenburg Addiction Treatment Services, meant to address the needs of the patients by helping them develop a positive attitude in achieving sobriety (St. Johns Riverside Hospital, 2020). Secondly, the agency provides community-based outpatient and hospital-based inpatient services. While the former avails day rehabilitation and treatment procedures for patients with chemical dependency, the latter gives supervised treatment to patients with withdrawal symptoms. Both services are meant to support the agency’s mission.

United Nations publications or documents are texts linked with the global institution’s agenda and released to the general public for awareness and educational purposes. UN documents apply to the services provided by St. Johns Riverside Hospital, and one of them is the Right to Health publication written by the World Health Organization (WHO). The document entails the major components of the right to health, the common misconceptions revolving around it, and its relationship with other human rights (OHCHR & WHO, 2008). The right to health as an inclusive right is one of the elements which states that the right is not only associated with access to health care facilities and services. It is also linked with all factors that contribute to healthy living. Safe food and drinking water, gender equality, healthy working conditions, and health-related information are other aspects included in the right to health.

Moreover, the document stipulates that the right to health also covers health-related freedoms. For instance, a patient has a right to reject non-consensual medical procedures, specifically those related to clinical experiments or research, in the name of trying to find a cure. The document protects patients from torture and inhumane treatment in medical facilities (OHCHR & WHO, 2008). Besides protection, the publication illustrates that the right to health issues entitlements and these include the privilege to important medication, equal access to timely health services, and public participation in health-related decision-making in communities.
Furthermore, the document emphasizes providing health care services and facilities without discrimination according to the non-discrimination tenet of UDHR. No one should be more important than another in receiving standard health care. Finally, the publication dictates that all services in medical facilities should be acceptable, available, accessible, and of good quality (OHCHR & WHO, 2008). This element applies to public and private health organizations tasked with ensuring that hospitals have enough health workers and sufficient supplies.

The UHC publication is similar in composition to the Right to Health but is concerned with improving the global population’s health in connection with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) of 2030. As part of the 2030 agenda, WHO introduced the declaration in response to the UN’s desire to double the health coverage by 2030. The plan is to give the privilege to 5 billion individuals who cannot access health care at the moment (United Nations, 2019). UN member states have taken the initiative to engage in the political process of improving key areas in providing universal health care. These components apply to both public hospitals and private medical facilities.

According to the UHC declaration document, one aspect that must be improved is the process of ensuring that no one is denied access to health care due to financial constraints. Nobody needs to choose between buying food and paying medical expenses, particularly for women and children. Moreover, governments are tasked with strengthening the health care workforce and improving the necessary infrastructure critical in achieving the UHC objectives. The publication indicates that the UN should be updated on the progress in 2023 (WHO, 2019). Consequently, all health care stakeholders, including national governments, donors, and private medical facilities, have a role in improving the existing primary health care systems that attend to most people’s medical needs.
</text>
<text>
Based on the information collected about St. Johns Riverside Hospital, the agency conforms to most of the items included in the Rights to Health and the Universal Declaration on Universal Health Coverage documents. The company incorporates various aspects of the right to health document into its mission and services. For instance, SJRH practices inclusivity in providing access to health care by availing medical services to the addicts and giving them helpful education and information, as indicated in the agency’s mission. The hospital understands that treating the patients is not enough and that they need the correct knowledge to help them deal with their condition once they are out of the facility. Furthermore, the health organization provides complete access to the health entitlements defined in the publication. Although SJRH specializes in medical and nursing care to the addicts, it still provides accessible and acceptable inpatient and outpatient services to its clients, and this also applies to preventive care (OHCHR & WHO, 2008). No one is discriminated against, and as long as they meet the criteria of receiving treatment, they are attended to.
</text>
<text>
Secondly, SJRH factors in the components of the UN Declaration on UHC in its mission statement, departments, operations, and services. For example, St. Johns Riverside Greenburg (ATS) is classified as a non-profit organization and only relies on donor funding from Medicaid, Medicare, and Charity to run its operations. This implies that the company does not need to charge its patients, making the medical services affordable to everyone. The company’s policy supports UHC’s main objective to help patients with financial hardships access high-quality health care services as any other person (WHO, 2019). Similarly, the document indicates that it is the responsibility of all health care stakeholders, SJRH included ensuring the issues listed in the declaration are addressed. The agency plays its role by practicing professionalism and ethics, which strengthens the workforce, and also invests in state-of-art technologies which enhance medical infrastructure. St John’s Agency’s stand in advocating for the Right to Health and Universal Health Coverage is clear in its policies.
Human rights consciousness is the degree of awareness an individual or a group has on the existing rights and freedoms stipulated by a constitution or concerned laws. St Johns Riverside Hospital has a moderate degree of human rights consciousness because some of the aspects of its operations, strategies, and policies attend to the human needs of the company stakeholders. The agency is a health care institution and demonstrates respect for the right to health care by making the medical services not only affordable but also accessible and acceptable in Westchester County.

Similarly, the medical facility respects its patients’ wishes concerning administering treatment, giving them the freedom to accept or reject the concerned therapies. Additionally, freedom of expression is another vital component of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) that SJRH prioritizes in its operations (United Nations, 2020). A section of the agency’s mission statement indicates that the company is open to new directions, ideas, and initiatives that will improve its response to the community’s health care needs. However, other aspects of human rights such as equality have not been mentioned in the company policies and mission.

St. Johns Riverside Hospital is human rights conscious, but there is a need for improvement. One critical area that needs to be addressed is the right to equality and prohibition of discrimination, as stipulated in the UDHR. SJRH is a service-based agency that can attract various forms of discrimination, such as racism and gender segregation. Since this is a key human rights element, the organization should incorporate it into its service, policies and integrate it into its mission statement. Moreover, the agency should create more emphasis on the right to health care since it is its area of specialization. Currently, SJRH has made its services available to various locations in Westchester County, which is a positive step. However, the company should improve on the right to health-related information, which will ensure patients can cater for themselves after leaving the facility and enhance the recovery process.

Most of Adam Smith’s arguments on capitalism, labor, class conflict, and stages of history (or social development) are contained in his book Wealth of Nations. The stages of history in Adam Smith’s writing, as reiterated by Paganelli (2020), are the age of hunters, the age of shepherds, the age of agriculture, and the age of commerce. Smith believes that these stages explain the progress of a man in society. The society started from hunting societies (in some publications such as Svizzero and Tisdell (2016) claim hunter-gatherers) who eventually realize that domesticating wild animals and collecting fruits was an easier way of obtaining food (the shepherds’ age). Population growth and other social developments demanded a more stable supply of food and agriculture developed as a result. The superfluous products left after meeting the consumption needs were traded for other products, and hence the rise of the commerce age.

Adam Smith is optimistic about capitalism because he sees it as the foundation of economic growth where individuals are allowed to produce as much surplus as possible and trade it for a profit. In the Wealth of Nations, Smith argues that the best economic system is characterized by natural liberty where individuals can trade items of value in exchange for others of greater value to them. He defines capital as stock and profit as the expectation of retaining revenues from improvements implemented on the stock (Smith, 2007). Capital and profit are, therefore, the major drivers behind the dynamic of capitalism according to Adam Smith.
</text>
<text>
The conflicts in capitalism are also highlighted in Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations where the main idea behind the conflicts is competition. According to Hearn (2018), competition is central to the Wealth of Nations and it causes conflicting interests between the traders and/or manufacturers and the public. The traders/manufacturers seek to widen the market and narrow competition to enable them to gain profits above what they would normally get. Such intentions are contrary to the interests of the public who would like to acquire items at reasonable prices. According to Smith (2007), conflict is a part of human nature. Book III of the Wealth of Nations explains the sources of conflicts including the resources that are unevenly distributed and people went to war in pursuit of control of the resources.
Capital is seen as a power and the class conflicts are majorly between the capitalists and laborers emanate from conflicting interests. In chapter 8 of Book I, Smith (2007) argues that one of the two parties will have an advantage in disputes and would force the other into compliance. The capitalists are more powerful and the law authorized or failed to prohibit their combinations while at the same time prohibiting those of the workmen.

The logic of the labor theory of value in Smith’s analysis is that labor can be a tradable commodity whose value can be assessed in the same way as all others traded in a mercantile system. As mentioned earlier, surplus items are traded for items of greater value. When people possess skills needed in production, they become valuable to the manufacturer who attaches a price to the skills. In the Wealth of Nations, Smith (2007) argues that just like in barter where people obtained from one another the goods they needed, the division of labor allows people to produce commodities in surplus and trade them for those made by other people. Adam Smith also states that the possibility of exchanging the surplus of own labor encourages people to apply themselves to a particular occupation and to perfect their talents.
</text>
<text>
The main ideas of mercantilism are derived from Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations where the term mercantile system was used to refer to the trade systems in the period between the 15 th and 18 th centuries. According to Beuve et al. (2016), the mercantile system was characterized by illiberal policies followed by the monarchs, including protectionism, money and power, and widespread monopolies among others. The mercantilism system seeks to achieve a balance between economic development and national power and wealth. The key objectives of such a system, therefore, include the expansion of the domestic industry, pursuing favourable commercial balances, augmenting bullion stocks, and acquiring large shares of the foreign trade. These ideas can be seen in Smith’s (2007) Wealth of Nations, specifically Book IV that discusses the systems of political economy. Smith (2007) argues that the mercantile system comprises of money that acts both as a measure of value and an instrument of commerce. The mercantile system is a system of wealth accumulation from commercial activity. Legal constraints such as duties on trade and prohibitions are also seen as elements of Smith’s idea of a mercantile system.

Physiocracy, on the other hand, can be seen as a contrast to the mercantile system that insisted on free trade to allow people to easily trade their surplus. Physiocracy is an ideological system that claimed that the economic activities should be determined by natural-divine laws and strictly called against the state’s interference with the operation of those laws (Genç & Kurt, 2016). The government control of the commercial activity in France is seen as the roots of Physiocracy. In 1764, economic policies such as the ‘freedom of grain’ resulted in high grain prices that ruined the poor with some dying of malnutrition. The policies were halted and the older regime of controlled prices and wages restored by the monarchy (Gauthier, 2015). The physiocrats perceived profit as more important than life itself and the traders wanted all the freedom regardless of the impacts of their action on the economy. The common ideas between mercantilism and Physiocracy is that they all sought free trade.

The Malthusian theory of population is among the most important models of population control. The main tenet of the Malthusian theory is that when unchecked, the population increases in a geometrical ratio while the subsistence of man increases in an arithmetic ratio (Malthus, 1998). First published in 1798 in his Essay on Population, Malthus simply sought to explain that the population grew at a faster rate than the rate of food production (among other sustenance products). The geometric progress can be displayed as 1×2, 2×2, 4×4.nx2. The arithmetic progression can be expressed as 1, 2, 3, 4…n. With these two models, it is observable that the population grows by multiplying itself while the sustenance is naturally sluggish (Rahman, 2018). The dangers of allowing population to grow unchecked are explained by Malthus (1998) using the idea of hunting as a means of obtaining food. He argues where hunting is the major occupation and an only mode of acquiring food and where the subsistence is scattered over a large territory, then the population must be comparatively thin to be supported by that economic activity.

The logic of the population theory is perhaps the fact that resources are scarce and do not increase in response to their demand. Population increases mean rising demand for sustenance from the scarce resource. Most importantly, the resources should be able to support human life meaning the only way to ensure a balance between the two elements is by controlling the population. Such logic is apparent in the developing world where the theory holds as opposed to the developed world where Malthusian theory fails to apply (Rahman, 2018). Subsequently, much of the politics of population control focus on the third world where the population has exploded over the past decades. Fertility rates in those countries are very high while the economic variables such as per capita GDP, urbanization, forced labor, and education levels are substandard (De Silva & Tenreyro, 2017). The developed world does not face such issues possibly because population control mechanisms have been effective.
</text>
<text>
Malthusian theory can be criticized for not basing its principles on historical facts as there is no evidence of population growing in a geometrical progression. In Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, the population growth is estimated at 2.7% a year year (The Economist, 2020). While that rate is the highest in the world, it does not show any form of geometric progression. The economic variables such as GDP for the same region indicate that the GDP growth rates for 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 are 1.43%, 3%, 3.27%, and 3.07%. Such figures indicate that the rate if sustenance growth could be matching the rate of population growth. Sub-Saharan Africa is used here because the region is a perfect example of developing countries and the population and economic dynamics should reflect those of the ordinary third world. Additionally, with technology advancements, it can be argued that the rate of sustenance growth can surpass that of the population growth with more efficient machines and methods of production. In the developed world, therefore, the theory would not apply as the production could potentially be higher than the rate of population growth.

Ricardo is considered to be among the most rigorous classical theorists. His rent theory states that the economic rent on land is the equivalent to the value of the difference in productivity between a piece of land and the poorest and/or most expensive land producing the same products under the same conditions. The idea behind this theory is that the appropriation of land and the consequent creation of rent often varies relative to the value of produce and independently of the labor quantities necessary for the production of the commodities (Ricardo, 2001). The landowners, therefore, are not free to choose the economic rent to charge on land as the rent was determined by the costs of the labourer. The marginal productivity, as opposed to labor, determines rent in contrast to Malthus argument. Such an argument could also contrast Adam Smith’s argument that the land rents also failed to reflect the landowner’s efforts (Ryan-Collins, 2017). Ricardo would have expected that the landlords would expropriate all the profits made from the land.

The idea of landowners capturing all the economic rent on the land has not been achieved in reality because it would require the landlords to have the powers of expropriation. The landowners, however, did not have such powers and the profits were usually shared with the tenant. Ricardo (2001) uses a simple expression stating that “corn is not high because a rent is paid, but rent is paid because corn is high” (p. 44). He goes further to argue that that rent paid on the land will become part of the price of the sold produce. Additionally, the land yields no rent when most abundant, most fertile, and most productive. Only when these powers diminish does a share of the original produce set apart for rent. The falling rate of profit insinuates that with the land rents constant, the profits from land diminished as more labor was used in the production.

There are several essential steps women need to make before getting pregnant to lower the risks and improve their health. First of all, a woman must revise nutrition, start eating well and take multivitamins. Folic acid is the most important as it prevents congenital disabilities like neural tube defects. Secondly, a woman must get a health checkup and genetic consulting to become aware of the risks and ways to avoid them. Thirdly, Liou et al. (2016) state that “prenatal visits incorporate psychological assessment for early detection and management to prevent possible adverse birth outcomes”. Mental health must be checked due to the high stress to come with the pregnancy. Lastly, there is a must in limiting or getting rid of bad habits like smoking or drinking alcohol and coffee.
A woman’s lifespan can affect the pregnancy; that’s why the conditions of a specific period of life should be considered before getting pregnant. When a woman is in any life crisis, there might be stress-related issues with her menstrual cycles, and the need for additional medical consultancy regarding hormones might appear. At the aging stage of life, a woman risks delivering an ill baby or to have a difficult pregnancy. Steps before getting pregnant, such as health checkups and multivitamins, should be carefully made.
Women who discover a failure to launch syndrome need to get psychological assistance before getting pregnant as their self-esteem and expectations are on a lower level at this life stage. The other stressful periods are marriage or divorce, as women might doubt their choices or be overwhelmed by the events. Getting pregnant in these conditions might severely affect women’s mental and physical health, and reliable medical and psychological support is recommended.

Generally, labor is divided into three stages. At the first stage, cervical dictation appears and keeps expanding until the active phase of labor. During the second stage, a woman pushes the baby through the birth canal with the intense contractions. The third stage is followed by the delivery of the placenta and called the afterbirth. After the placenta is out of the body, the midwife cuts the cord. Childbirth is a normal human experience, yet each labor is a unique process, so women perceive risks to life, and accompany it with intense fear and helplessness (Muzik & Rosenblum, 2017, p. 13). It is essential to provide a woman with psychological support during childbirth.
After Pregnancy
After giving birth, there are essential steps women must make for her and a baby’s health. At first, a woman must visit her postpartum checkups to prevent any health problems from appearing. Moreover, she must keep eating healthily and take vitamins to be able to breastfeed a child properly. A new mother must get baby care recommendations from a trusted consultant and follow them strictly during the first month of a child’s life.

Factors related to the pregnancy, such as type of birth, a pre-term newborn, health problems, negatively impact women’s quality of life (Martínez-Galiano et al., 2019). A woman’s life-span specifically impacts the after pregnancy period: a mother’s and a child’s health and wellness might be affected by life conditions. During crises, as well as stressful milestones like marriage or divorce, the after-pregnancy time might become a relief that distracts from harmful events. However, psychological assistance or family support might be required. A woman in such life-span conditions as aging has to get intense medical help during the after-pregnancy period as her health weakens after the stress of giving birth.

Regardless of the time of the year, weather, and country, there will be people drinking, buying, and making coffee. The coffee culture has expanded immensely with the introduction of global corporations providing hot drinks like Starbucks and Dunkin. There are many variations from bitter ice to seasonal pumpkin coffee, all of which are loved and purchased by coffee drinkers. Most of the known to humans coffee-making methods and hot drink types can be easily purchased at Starbucks or Dunkin. It has even entered the state of routine, so people stop noticing the differences between the producers as long as they get their desired drink. The problem is that the coffee made at the two cafes is similar, and it is difficult to differentiate for a casual buyer. However, there is a slight difference in taste between Starbucks and Dunkin coffee, which draws the careful attention of biomedical informatics scientists.

People usually associate coffee with a bitter taste, which may be a huge public delusion. When Tyler (2018) from Business Insider decided to compare Starbucks and Dunkin shops in downtown New York, she claimed bitterness as her coffee quality indicator. Tyler (2018) went to both bakery shops and structured an overall overview of the two, purchasing a cold brew as her final say. She stated that Dunkin’s drink was not “bitter, but … strong” and “super refreshing” (Tyler, 2018, para. 14). Still, Tyler (2018) preferred Starbucks for its stronger bitterness and cheaper price, emphasizing a less “watered down” state (para. 21). Although it may be just what is needed after a short sleep and before a long work-day ahead, a coffee expert Erika Vonie told Grub Street that professionally made pure coffee, espresso, should be “immediately sweet and creamy” instead (as cited in Richardson, 2018, para. 3). Interestingly, Vonie later declared Dunkin’s espresso a winner compared to Starbucks’ “over-extract[ed]” coffee, which prevented the sweet and creamy taste (Richardson, 2018, para. 7). In a chase for more customers who think of coffee as bitter, Starbucks makes their coffee too burnt to be enjoyed by experts like Vonie.

Bitter coffee taste forces many to add significant amounts of different sugars and syrups into their drinks, which can result in health problems. The impact of caffeine on the human body has long been debated in the medical world, which connects it to cardiovascular side effects (Grosso et al., 2017). Additional amounts of regular sugar and sugar-based syrups included in coffee making limit research conducted and can be harmful (Grosso et al., 2017). Problems linked to caffeine and in-coffee-sugar consumption are a part of medical informatics scientists’ approach to ensuring food safety. The healthcare data science can significantly improve the state of public treatment through discovering new innovative solutions and updating medical knowledge. The lack of cohesive and concrete information on all possible relationships between caffeine and human health pose an opportunity for informatics experts. More research in this field can go as far as confirming several benefits of coffee consumption, such as the prevention of chronic diseases (Grosso et al., 2017). Thus, the growing and widely practiced coffee culture has great potential for research, in which biomedical informatics is closely involved.

Both Starbucks and Dunkin companies make great and affordable coffee, which is enjoyed by millions of regular coffee drinkers worldwide. Even though their methods of making and selling hot and cold drinks differ, there are many similarities. For many, the difference is almost undiscoverable because their preferences are based on individual perceptions and experience with the products. Some might prefer bitter coffee, while others lean towards a sweeter version. The influence of caffeine and sugar on human organism has been an issue of major interest. Therefore, the industry stores an enormous potential for health informatics, which aims to ensure safety and prevent harmful outcomes.

Since the beginning of the year 2020, the world has faced a public health issue on a global scale. The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It first broke out in the Chinese province of Hubei in December 2019 and within a few months has spread worldwide triggering a global health alarm and changing the daily lives of millions of people across the globe. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) was the first country in the Middle East to report a coronavirus case at the end of January, followed by a steady increase in the number of positive cases. As of April 26, 2020, the UAE had 10,349 total confirmed cases (COVID-19 Update, 2020). The pandemic is a dynamic and fast-moving global health crisis, which poses an ongoing challenge to national security and stability.

Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the UAE has come up with legislation to counter this threat. Specifically, the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation developed policies that employers are required to promote remote working as a protective measure. Resolution No. 281 of 2020 restricts the percentage of employees that should be physically present in a workplace to 30% (Karasik, 2020). However, firms involved in the provision of food and health are exempt from this government policy. Additionally, customers served at any business should occupy only 30% of the seats in the establishment (Karasik, 2020). They must also adhere to safety measures, including hand hygiene and adorning masks.
Under the new law, employees must adopt protective measures, such as screening staff coming on a shift for fever and other symptoms. Companies are required to implement these measures twice daily and refer suspected cases to hospitals (Khoja et al., 2020). Employers must consider pregnant women, individuals aged above 55 years, the disabled, those with respiratory problems, and mothers with young children for remote working. They must equip these employees with technical tools and support to enable them to work from home.

The UAE defense industry is at the forefront of fighting the Covid-19 pandemic. The country has adopted a civil-military approach in the anti-viral strategies. Before the start of Ramadan, the military-medical defense program focused on disinfecting mosques and other religious places in Dubai (Khoja et al., 2020). The joint initiative has been useful in implementing social separation programs during this period. It has also played a key role in enforcement and civil control. The military-supported mosques are used to sensitize people on this disease to avoid rumors that may lead to panic buying.

The UAE has developed a Civil Defense plan to reinforce counter-measures against the spread of the pandemic. This program seeks to eliminate this virus in all the seven Emirates before Eid al-Fitr celebrations later this month (Sebugwaawo, 2020). Before then, a massive decontamination exercise has been undertaken across the kingdom. The 24-hour restriction of movement has facilitated this initiative. In Abu Dhabi, the military in collaboration with Tadweer, a waste management firm, has endeavored to eliminate the virus through chemical spraying of public spaces and buildings (Karasik, 2020). UAE’s neighbors, including Saudi Arabia, have adopted the same military-medical model to decontaminate places and enforce lockdowns within their boundaries. Another area where UAE’s defense industry has played a role is in port security and control of the border with Iran (Sebugwaawo, 2020). The goal is to stop the contagion from entering the country from countries with a large number of cases and weaker health systems.

The UAE has collaborated with regional and international partners to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. Its neighbors in the region, including Qatar, Oman, and Bahrain have adopted a military-medical approach modeled after UAE’s Civil Defense model (Khoja et al., 2020). Specifically, lockdown protocols and decontamination measures in these countries have been adapted from those of the UAE. The eastern Emirate jurisdiction of Qatif has collaborated with Iranian authorities in border control to prevent infected persons from entering the UAE through illegal routes (Sebugwaawo, 2020). Port security has also involved coordination with officials from neighboring countries.
Moreover, the UAE has offered to give medical assistance to different countries. Abu Dhabi’s Crown Prince has been in touch with the governments of Italy, Serbia, and Iraq on how the kingdom can boost the efforts of these nations in fighting the pandemic (Sebugwaawo, 2020). This soft power approach centers on preventive measures. The country has committed to providing medicines and personal protective gear to nations with weak health care systems.

Statistical inference is used to summarize data from the sample for the entire population. In fact, the sample is never a 100% population model, but only its more or less distorted version. Statistical inference is used to evaluate such distortions and, therefore, to draw more accurate conclusions about the general population. It is important to remember that achieving a 100% guarantee that the study results are characteristic of the general population is possible only when continuous research is conducted. For example, the survey of all representatives of the general population. In this case, the electorate is not limited only to students, so Sara’s conclusions regarding the election results cannot be considered correct.
Most statisticians claim the minimum size of samples for obtaining meaningful results should be at least 100. Nevertheless, the surveyed population group may be less than 100. In such cases, it is appropriate to study the total size of them. Statisticians use the term “good maximum”: it means that the surveyed population sample size is about 10% of the overall available quantity (“How to choose,” n.d.). For instance, for the population of 3000, 10% would be 300, whereas, in a population of 10,000, it would be 1,000.
The number of samples closer to the minimum is chosen in specific conditions. It is appropriate when the result’s rough estimate is needed. It is also applied when the sample is not planned to be divided into diverse groups during the survey. Additionally, a “good maximum” is relevant when it is supposed that most people are likely to answer similarly, or the conclusions of the study will not have any significant consequences. In the situation with the president’s elections on the state level, the potential electorate is far broader than the students.

Sara’s simple explanation might be as follows: she might be proposing to imagine that she wants to survey her friends at a high school. The chosen group enrolls fifty students, so she needs to scan all of them. Still, the obtained results would give her a rough idea of potential election results (“Statistical inference,” n.d.). If she wants to find valid perspectives, the surveyed group should be at least 100 people, including not only her friends but also the representatives of the whole high school’s staff. Hence, it would be appropriate to engage the students, teachers, ordinary school workers, parents, friends, and other available electorate groups.

The COVID-19 pandemic and related quarantine measures have severely affected the economic situation all over the globe. Multiple restrictions on international transportation and, in some states, inter-regional traffic, as well as the requirement to spend most of the time at home, have substantially affected the worldwide supply chain. According to Ma et al. (2020), the pandemic is fraught with, among other things, increased unemployment, a sharp decline in GDP, and financial market volatility. This paper examines the global financial consequences and the business impacts of quarantine measures taken in many countries.

It should be noted that the global economy is not encountering such a phenomenon for the first time. The research group examined the economic impact of historical epidemics and pandemics of the previous millennium (Jorda et al., 2020). The results revealed that there had been a significant decline in asset returns, a period of depressed investment opportunities over several decades, and a negative impact on wage levels. At the same time, the impact of the pandemic and quarantine activities on the economy is already evident. Researchers state that “direct supply disruptions will hinder production since the disease is focused on the world’s manufacturing heartland (East Asia) and spreading fast in the other industrial giants – the US and Germany” (Baldwin & di Mauro, 2020, p. 4). Disruptions in major production sites are already beginning to have a significant effect on both the private and public economic sectors.
It is particularly significant to emphasize that the economic implications of the pandemic will affect even countries with low morbidity and lack of quarantine measures. Due to the global situation, the economic activity of international companies has dropped dramatically, as well as the prices of many products and resources, including oil. These circumstances will adversely affect both commodity economies and producers of goods and services.
Business Impacts

It should be noted that despite the general adverse economic trend, some market participants benefited from the situation. According to Koren and Peto (2020), “businesses that rely heavily on face-to-face communication or close physical proximity when producing a product or providing a service are particularly vulnerable” (p. 13). At the same time, companies whose activities are related to social media and digital space, or allow remote work, either do not suffer from excessive adverse conditions or even experience increased demand. Some businesses whose operations are particularly crucial during quarantine, such as food delivery companies or scientific medical facilities, also increase profits.

However, all companies have higher expenditures on additional safety measures. Most of the companies whose operations are associated with a face-to-face presence have been severely affected. This is mainly relevant to transport organizations, restaurant and hotel business, retail, as well as art and entertainment industry, are particularly affected. Researchers argue that the pandemic will reduce the companies’ profitability, hurt employment, and may also increase debts (Ma et al., 2020). State financial support is particularly useful for small and medium-sized businesses, but not all governments are able to provide it.

One of the striking examples of media with stereotypes is the advertising of a sportswear brand Nike. Undoubtedly, this company is trying to produce quality products and pays much attention to brand development. However, in their advertising, people who wear Nike clothes and shoes are usually healthy, athletic, and beautiful. This creates the stereotype that only slim people can be successful in sports. Thus, many people with non-standard parameters of their figure are embarrassed to start working out because they are afraid to seem ridiculous, although society would actually support them. Therefore, to reduce the negative impact of advertising on people, marketers must take a responsible approach to its development and take into account the interests of different population groups.

The use of stereotypes in cinema is a critical issue. On the one hand, this allows creating vivid and understandable characters. On the other hand, this can reinforce negative prejudices in the minds of viewers. Therefore, the development of characters should be approached carefully. Fortunately, in recent years, screenwriters and directors have been trying to avoid the tendency toward stereotyping in cinema. They are interested in creating unusual and original characters. Thanks to this, viewers see the multifaceted nature of a human being, which allows them to become what they want and reach new heights.
Stokely Carmichael’s Contribution to Black Nationalism Essay
Introduction
Stokely Carmichael is a civil rights activist and founder of the notion of “Black Power.” He showed himself as a brilliant student both at school and university, where he became interested in the topic of civil rights (“Stokely Carmichael: West Indian-American Activist”).
His path in civil rights activism began by becoming a member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (the SNCC). This essay focuses on Stokely Carmichael’s contribution to black nationalism. Although Carmichael faced difficulties during his journey to a life without racial inequality, he did not stop and kept spreading the slogan “black power” to London, Cuba, and Vietnam.
Stokely Carmichael’s Participation in Civil Rights Actions

Stokely Carmichael took part in many civil rights organizations, including his participation in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee led by James Forman, Bob Mosses, and Marion Barry (“SNCC”). The party aimed to provide black people with equal rights in civic actions. In 1966, Carmichael was elected as the head of this party, in which he integrated the term “Black Power” that characterized violence as self-defense. Carmichael was also a member of the Freedom Riders, a civil rights movement that fought against racial segregation. (“Stokely Carmichael: West Indian-American Activist”). The experience he got from participating in these actions prepared him for one of the most important marches in his life, the Meredith March.

The purpose of the Meredith March was to create equal rights for black voters to remove the fear of many black people to cross Mississippi and to fight against racism. It was organized by James Meredith in 1966 and implied a walk from Memphis to Jackson (Joseph, p. 77). During his second day, an unknown man shot Meredith and injured him. The journalists reported the news with an error saying that Meredith was killed. Even though the updating was done less than an hour later, the incident raised a wave of resentment among people. The new head of the Congress of Racial Equality Floyd McKissick announced the continuation of the movement and promised to finish it by gathering volunteers. This march embraced the Black Power notion and made Carmichael a prominent figure by representing him as a national civil rights activist. The movement lasted from May 8 till June 29, ending with a tribute of black and white people seeking justice and equality for everyone; even famous figures such as Marlon Brando joined in.

One of the challenges that Carmichael faced was whites’ hostility towards marches. During the Meredith March, when the crowd reached the Madison County Courthouse, the officials forbade protesters to pitch the tents (Joseph, p. 87). Despite the prohibition, Carmichael gave the order to settle down in front of McNeal Elementary School. This act led to the punishment of the protesters by patrolmen. They were throwing the gas canisters into people, but Carmichael and McKissick kept chanting, “Pitch the tents.” It was not the only violent act from the police troops. After each police attack, Carmichael was pointing at them, saying that these people are not able to protect anyone if they beat women and children and throw gas canisters at them. He took every opportunity to show the real face of the American political system.

During the march, Carmichael became a close friend with already well-known civil rights activist Martin Luther King-Jr, whose views and values although differed in some points were quite similar to Carmichael’s. The difference in opinions was another problem that Carmichael faced during his movements. King showed disapproval of the notion of “Black Power” because he saw violence in it. In his speeches, he expressed the position of many black people who were furious because of the attempt to murder James Meredith, at the same time reminding them of nonviolent politics. However, later King states, “If Stokely Carmichael now says that nonviolence is irrelevant, it is because he, as a dedicated veteran of many battles, has seen with his own eyes the most brutal white violence against Negroes and white civil rights workers, and he has seen it go unpunished” (p. 34). This shows his compromise with Carmichael on the issue of racial desegregation.

Despite difficulties, Carmichael kept traveling and giving speeches on civil rights freedom. People in London treated him as an idol and listened to his glorious speeches. He realized that the nonviolent tactics will not work, that is why he refused to talk about the topic of nonviolence and instead spoke about relevant things, such as self-defense. Although people loved him, he faced resentment from authorities and had to depart from London. He was invited by the Cuban officials to attend the Organization for Latin American Solidarity (Joseph, p. 144). There he became acquainted with Fidel Castro, Cuban human rights activist. His travel to Havana, Carmichael describes as “eye-opening, inspiring, and mind-blowing” (Joseph, p. 146). Later he booked a flight to Vietnam where he took part in actions against the Vietnam War.

To conclude, Stokely Carmichael’s contribution to racial equality was prominent. With his sharp mind and dedication on the way to making his nation free from discrimination he could convey a message to the masses, and people listened to him. The slogan” black power” inspired people to fight against injustice and racial discrimination, to define their rights, and to build a united community. Although he experienced some difficulties such as whites’ hostility and aim determination of the movements, he was conscious of these challenges and took advantage of them to subdue other countries with his great speeches.

One of the central reasons for the decline and failure of Kodak was the inability to correctly evaluate the current situation and disregard of digital technology and opportunities that were associated with it. The given strategic failure also resulted from the corporate blunders that were inevitable regarding the corporate culture peculiar to the company at that period. By 2011, the traditional photography business was eroded by digital cameras and smartphones with a turnover of about $6 billion. It became fatal for Kodak, which experienced a gradual deterioration of its competitive advantage because of the inability to respond to new changes. The company made incorrect conclusions about the future of traditional photography and its ability to compete with innovations that started to penetrate the market. In such a way, Kodak’s dismissive response to new trends was one of the primary causes of the strategic drift.

At the same time, because of the wrong idea about the future of the sphere and the evolution of the film sphere. Instead of devoting much attention to innovative devices, Kodak viewed digital as the method to enhance film business, and this idea failed. Additionally, the corporate culture of the company and its adherence to traditional values impacted the choice of a new CEO Whitmore known for its interest to film business. The given decision influenced the future evolution of the company and its failure to consider new technologies as a way to remain beneficial and preserve the competitive advantage. In such a way, the primary reasons for strategic drift include the wrong analysis of the situation, inability to predict the development of technology, and too conservative corporate culture that was not able to accept new trends and the need to start working with digital technologies as the contribution to the future growth.

Emirates Airline is a Dubai-based leading global aviation company. It is also Middle East’s most valuable airline brand and the national flag carrier for the United Arab Emirates (UAE). As a state-owned enterprise managed by the Emirates group of Companies, Emirates Airline has grown from a small flight company in the mid-1980s to one of the world’s most formidable airline brands with a market presence in six continents. While its success is largely commendable, Emirates Airline needs to come up with new strategies to support its next phase of growth. This report identifies and evaluates different factors relating to the company’s internal and external environment that would affect the aforementioned goal. The external environmental analysis will be undertaken using the PESTLE tool, external factor matrix and competitive portfolio matrix. Comparatively, the analysis of the internal environment will be undertaken using the internal factor evaluation matrix and the SWOT analysis method. The SWOT analysis technique will be used to evaluate the company’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, while the PESTLE analysis will be used to evaluate the political, economic, environmental, social, technological, legal and economic forces affecting its operations.

From the above analysis, ineffective marketing was identified as the main issue characterizing Emirate’s internal and external environment and that has the potential to influence the company’s future operations. Particularly, it is established that Emirates Airline is not equipped to exploit the myriad of opportunities that emerge from the growing prominence of the millennial generation as a powerful target demographic in air travel and the rising cohorts of middle-class populations in emerging markets who are eager to travel. Therefore, Emirate’s current strategic environment is not well adapted to exploit these new market opportunities. Relative to this challenge, three long-term objectives have been formulated to improve the company’s future market positioning. They are outlined below:

To meet the above goals, it is recommended that Emirates should inculcate a new cultural ideology of innovation that would accommodate new ideas in product development as opposed to the current corporate environment that is heavily top-down and ineffective in addressing changing consumer tastes and preferences. Relative to these facts, it is proposed that Emirates Airline should redesign its training programs to teach existing employees about newer ways of addressing the needs of millennial travelers. Similarly, the airline’s management should allocate more resources to the company’s research and development department to spur more innovation and churn out new ideas on how to develop new products that would fit the needs of the target demographic.

Emirates Airline is one of the world’s leading aviation brands with a market presence in more than 80 countries and a fleet of more than 250 aircraft, which fly to six continents around the world (Corder, 2019). The United Arab Emirates (UAE) – based corporation is part of a larger group of companies known as “the Emirates Group,” which operates other subsidiary firms in the aviation sector. Emirate’s main operational hub is the Dubai International Airport where about 3,600 flights are set off per week (Emirates Group, 2020). The airline has more than 59,000 employees and rakes in more than $25 billion per annum in revenue (Corder, 2019). According to the company’s website, it has flown more than 56 million passengers across a vast network of 150 cities around the world between the years 2018 and 2019 (Emirates Group, 2020). The company’s vision statement is “to make civil aviation safe, leading and sustainable” (Emirates Group, 2020, p. 5), while its mission statement is “to deliver the world’s best in-flight experience” (Emirates Group, 2020, p. 5).

In this report, the internal and external factors affecting Emirate’s operations will be evaluated with the view to improve its strategic preparedness to address future challenges. The external environmental analysis will be undertaken using the PESTLE analysis, external factor evaluation matrix and competitive profile matrix. Comparatively, the analysis of internal factors will be undertaken using the internal factor evaluation matrix and the SWOT analysis tool. The strategic recommendations propose to din the report will be supported by evidence gathered from the use of the grand strategy matrix, Boston consulting group matrix and Strategic Position and Action Evaluation (SPACE) Matrix. The end of the evaluation will outline a set of proposals for improving the company’s strategic focus on market expansion, including a raft of measures that should be adopted to review the status of the progress made.

Emirates Airline traces its roots to 1984, when the then minister of defense, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, asked the managing director of another company known as “dnata” to evaluate the prospects of starting an airline company in the UAE. By the end of 1984, a business plan was set up and the name “Emirates” was chosen as the name for the new airline. In 1985, Sir Maurice Flanagan who was the managing director of “dnata” was tasked with the responsibility of starting the airline with a $10 million budget (Emirates Group, 2020). The mission was simple – to start an airline that would “look good, be good, and make money” (Emirates Group, 2020, p. 1). To fulfill this mission, the company’s director entered into a lease partnership agreement with Pakistan Airlines where it received Boeing 737s. This aircraft was used for the first flight in October 1985, from Dubai to Karachi and Mumbai (Companies History, 2020). In its first five years of operations, Emirates was already operating across 14 destinations that included Amman, Colombo, Cairo, Dhaka, Male, Frankfurt, Istanbul, Damascus, Jeddah, and Kuwait (Emirates Group, 2020).

In 1992, Emirates Airlines started to cut a niche for itself in the market by upgrading its in-flight entertainment. In this setup, the company was the first airline to install video systems in all the seats (Emirates Group, 2020). In terms of logistical capabilities, Emirate’s operational plans were significantly boosted when it moved into a newly refurbished terminal at the Dubai International Airport (Stephens et al. , 2017). In 1992, the Dubai-based airline made headlines for being the first airline to order Boeing 737s. This was a mark of confidence for the airline industry, which was suffering in the aftermath of the gulf war, to become profitable again. In 1993, it was also among the first airlines to pioneer inflight connectivity across all its classes, thereby garnering a lot of attention in the industry. Emirate’s first expansion plan was completed in 1998 when it acquired a 43% stake in Air Lanka (Emirates Group, 2020). In 1999, the growth of Dubai as an airline hub in the Middle East further led to Emirate’s success in the region and around the world. Supported by the expansion and development of new terminals in Dubai International Airport, the airline benefitted from increased passenger numbers, which peaked at 11 million people in the 1999/2000 financial year (Emirates Group, 2020). Out of this number, Emirates Airlines carried 4.7 million of passengers. Towards the end of the 90s, the airline also expanded its transport network by adding 28 more new routes. Between 2000 and 2010, the company added 46 more routes as well (Emirates Group, 2020).

As part of its growth and expansion plans of the mid 2000s, Emirates airline signed a partnership deal with Qantas airline to improve the quality of services offered to both sets of customers. The partnership agreement required both airlines to not only share codes but also undertake integrated network collaboration activities to provide its customers with improved benefits and services (Centre for Aviation, 2016). These strategies helped the airline to rise to the top of the hierarchy of competitive airlines in the world – a fete that led to its culmination as the most valuable airline brand in 2014 (World Airline Awards, 2020). In the Middle East, the airline was ranked as being the most valuable company with an estimated value of about $3.7 billion (Centre for Aviation, 2016). In 2016, it was named the world’s best airline (IBP, Inc., 2015). Its in-flight entertainment also continued to gain global attention for having twelve consecutive wins at the Skytrax World Airline Awards (World Airline Awards, 2020). Furthermore, from 2010 to 2019, the company added 54 new routes to its transport network (Emirates Group, 2020).
Industry and Market Share
The global airline industry is a multibillion-dollar economic sector, which supports livelihoods in many countries around the world. According to figure 1 below, in 2019, it was estimated that the industry’s market size was in excess of $801 billion (Statista, 2020). This figure is expected to significantly decline to $686 in 2020 due to global economic uncertainties.
Figure 1. Market size of the aviation industry
The decline in market size for the overall aviation industry is a negative sign for the industry because it means that there will be reduced business for most airlines. This aviation market is controlled by several leading airlines such as Lufthansa, American Airlines, and the likes.

Emirates primarily operate in the Asia-Pacific region, which has the highest market share in terms of passenger traffic across the entire global aviation industry (Statista, 2020). For example, the Asia-pacific market accounts for about 36.3% of the total global airline market share followed by Europe, which has a 26.3% market share (IATA, 2018). North American, Latin America and the Middle East follow each other in terms of market size at 23% 7%, and 5.3%, respectively (IATA, 2018). Lastly, Emirates is the third-largest airline after American and Delta Airlines in terms of schedule passenger numbers flown in the airline industry (Centre for Aviation, 2016).

It is essential to understand the external and internal environmental factors affecting the aviation industry. In particular, it is essential to have a deeper understanding of the issues affecting the airline and how they can be solved. For purposes of analyzing external factors influencing the business, three key models are used: PESTLE analysis, external factor evaluation matrix, and competitive profile matrix. Comparatively, the internal environmental analysis will be undertaken using the SWOT analysis and the internal factor evaluation matrix. The first phase of review involves an analysis of the external environment highlighted below.

Political: The international nature of Emirates’ operations exposes it to several political risks stemming from multiple countries. For example, restrictions in travel movements across borders due to health risks could significantly affect the viability of the company’s operations and whether it will make profits at all (Sales, 2016). Already, Emirates flies to some of the world’s emerging aviation markets, such as the Middle East and Africa. So far, most of these countries have a stable political environment. However, this situation could change and significantly suppress the demand for air transport. Similarly, unilateral actions were taken by different nations, such as the recent banning of flights to the US from specific Islam countries by the Trump administration could lead to a significant decline in air transport demand for airlines that ply routes in affected countries.

Economic: Being a global airline, Emirates operates in multiple markets with different currencies and economic characteristics. Therefore, changes in economic conditions could significantly influence the airline’s revenues and bottom-line performance (Sales, 2016). For example, the loss of value in one currency could mean a significant reduction in revenue in some markets. Similarly, the non-oil investments made in the UAE economy through advances in tourism product development have significantly affected the airline’s operations through increased passenger traffic, as more people fly into the Arab country to enjoy its tourism products and services. This model of investment has had a positive impact on Emirate’s performance by making Dubai and the larger UAE region an international tourism hub. The airline is strategically positioned to benefit from the associated passenger traffic.
</text>
<text>
Socio-cultural: The sociocultural aspect of the PESTLE analysis relates to changes in the social environment, which influence Emirate’s bottom-line performance. For example, an increased interest in air travel among young people throughout the world has had a positive impact on the airline’s operations as it has increased demand for the airline’s services. Similarly, the general increase in the world’s population has meant an automatic surge in the demand for travel services, which has improved Emirate’s overall performance. It is estimated that the most active demographic group that fuels current demand is made up of “baby boomers” who are engaged in frequent travels as they are at the top of their careers. Others are retiring and have chosen to travel instead of staying at home. The millennial generation is also actively involved in flying and is responsible for the high demand for air travel in some tourism markets (Machado and Davim, 2018). However, this demographic has different preferences, expectations, and attitudes about air travel from their older counterparts. For example, they have an insatiable appetite to travel, regardless of the prevailing economic or social conditions, and significantly rely on technology to make online travel bookings or stay engaged with their peers in their travel plans. Lastly, the growing middle-class population in many emerging markets is also fuelling the demand for air travel, which is, in turn, increasing the demand for airline services (Business News Publishing, 2017). For example, there is a surge in the demand for air travel among many emerging economies, such as the BRICS countries, including Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa because of increased disposable income among most of their populations (Vaughan-Whitehead, 2016). Therefore, airlines can exploit this emerging opportunity for greater market expansion.

Technological: The importance of technology in promoting business performance cannot be overemphasized in airline operations because of its strategic role in creating synergy across different functional areas. For example, technology has revolutionized how customers book flights and consume their entertainment while on transit. Similarly, aviation experts have used digital technology to forecast demand for aviation services and make plans on how to manage them (Belobaba, Odoni and Barnhart, 2015). Currently, there is a growing demand among some customers to further use technology to manage personal itineraries using mobile phones (Hanke, 2016). Particularly, this trend is common among millennial travelers (Belobaba, Odoni and Barnhart, 2015). The use of technology in this format provides airlines with an opportunity to customize their products to reflect the technological appeal of airline services. Alternatively, technology has also affected the operational costs of airlines by improving fuel efficiency through the development of modern aircraft. Companies like Emirates are always under pressure to adopt these technological changes through the purchase of modern aircraft that would improve performance and services offered to customers.

Environmental: The aviation industry is regarded as one of the most significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions around the world. Independent reports suggest that the sector is responsible for about 12% of the total greenhouse gases emitted in the atmosphere (Cook and Billig, 2017). This problem is worsened by the vulnerability of airlines to adverse weather conditions. For example, extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes and tornadoes have a negative impact on airline operations. The effects of adverse weather on flight operations was reported in 2010 when there was a volcanic ash cloud in Iceland that caused the delay of multiple flights across Europe (Cook and Billig, 2017). This event led to the closure of all airports in Scotland and created significant disruptions in other linked transport hubs in Manchester, Liverpool and New Castle because of the fear that the natural event could damage aircraft engines (Oregon State University, 2020). Broadly, this statement shows that the aviation industry is vulnerable to environmental factors affecting flight operations.
</text>
<text>
Legal: The aviation industry is one of the most regulated economic sectors because of the sensitivity of flight operations to human life. Although safety remains a top priority in the sector, governments have used new policies and laws to redefine industry outcomes based on competitive behaviors among regional and national airlines (Jarvis, 2015). For instance, the growing prominence of Middle East Airlines, such as Emirates, Etihad Airlines, and Qatar Airways, has increased rivalry in the airline market, especially between traditional western airlines and emerging state-sponsored companies in the Middle East and Asia (Peoples and Bitzan, 2017). The trend has forced some governments to impose protectionist policies to safeguard their national airlines from the negative effects of stiff competition (Gross and Lück, 2016). For example, the prohibition of air travel from some Middle East countries into the United States (US) is a form of protectionist policy that limits the outreach of Middle East Airlines in the American market. However, there has been a growing admission among key players in the aviation industry that the sector needs to be further liberalized (Cook and Billig, 2017). This is why there are increased cases of renegotiated open skies agreements emerging as a competitive strategy.

The competitive profile matrix is used to evaluate a company’s position relative to its competitors. By doing so, it is easier to identify its relative strengths and weaknesses. The information can be used to understand which areas need improvement and which ones need protection or safeguards. Similar to the PESTLE analysis, this external environment analysis tool is mostly used to estimate the impact of external factors on a company’s performance. In developing the competitive profile matrix, there was a keen emphasis on correctly estimating critical success factors associated with the airline industry that create an “edge” for one airline over another. As highlighted in Table 1 below, the main critical success factors used were brand reputation, the extent of product integration, range of products, rate of bringing new products to market, market share, employee satisfaction, customer service, brand loyalty, customer retention, superior, information technology (IT) capabilities, strong online presence, and successful promotion.
Alternatively, Emirate’s main competitors in the Middle East region (Etihad Airways and Oman Air) were evaluated based on the critical success factors highlighted above, and the results are highlighted in table 1 below.
</text>
<text>
The critical success factors highlighted above refer to the most important attributes of airline services that should be performed at the highest possible level of standard to realize a favourable market position. According to the results of the competitive profile table above, Emirates Airline leads its competitors in meeting the highest standards of excellence in the critical success factors identified with a score of 2.94, compared to its rival, Etihad (2.39) and Oman Air (2.75). Since critical success factors capture internal and external forces affecting a business, Emirates airline seems to have a better understanding of prevailing market dynamics because it has managed to respond well to current challenges by churning innovative products and services that have been well received by the market. For example, its world-acclaimed in-flight service entertainment is like no other in the industry. It has played a key role in boosting the company’s brand image among consumers. On this basis of assessment, some of the critical success factors highlighted in table 1 above are linked to one another because a good score in one area of service quality would automatically lead to the improvement of a related area. For example, brand loyalty would lead to increased levels of customer retention.

Unlike the internal factor, evaluation matrix that evaluates a company’s in-house capabilities with the view of identifying its strengths and weaknesses, the external factor evaluation matrix is used to assess the external environment to identify threats and opportunities that exist in the market. In this regard, Emirate’s external environment can be assessed based on the opportunities and threats that exist in the market. The growing middle class population in many emerging economies, such as South Africa and India, portends a significant opportunity for the airline to expand its travel network to serve new markets (McLeod and Croes, 2018). Additionally, airlines have benefitted from signing partnerships and agreements that are geared towards exploiting such opportunities (McLeod and Croes, 2018).

Emirate’s partnership with Qantas is one of the most significant partnership agreement that the Dubai-based airline has entered into. Signed in 2012, the partnership agreement allowed Qantas the right to use Emirate’s Dubai hub for logistical purposes (Emirates Group, 2020). The two airlines also agreed on a code and revenue sharing agreement that would improve operations both in Sydney and in the UAE (Emirates Group, 2020). Broadly, Emirates has been steadily following this strategic plan of entering into partnership with other airlines as was recently reported when it published its intention to work with American Airline as well to benefit from the same advantages it has accrued from the Qantas agreement (McLeod and Croes, 2018). Coming from the backdrop of the Emirates-Qantas partnership agreement, Emirates airline has made it known that it does not fear to pursue partnerships, which will benefit its shareholders and create value for its customers.

The growing demand for cargo traffic in the aviation sector has also emerged as another opportunity for Emirates Airline to expand its market share. This opportunity is occasioned by the decline in passenger traffic in the first quarter of 2020 and fears that the trend is expected to continue in the future (Diamond, 2020). Lastly, the sophisticated taste of the modern passenger also creates another opportunity for airlines to develop products that appeal to the changing needs of their clients. Particularly, emphasis has been made to understand the unique transport needs of the millennial traveller because their demographic will soon encompass a majority of the population of airline passengers (McLeod and Croes, 2018). On this basis of growth, there is potential for airlines to further develop products that appeal to the unique market needs of these growing demographics, as they will largely define future consumer tastes and preferences.

According to table 2 above, the growing prominence of other Middle Eastern airlines is problematic for Emirates Airline because it threatens its dominant position in the market. Again, as highlighted in this analysis, the activities of Emirate’s rivals in global aviation industry challenges its position as the Gulf region’s leading airline because it means that other Middle Eastern airlines are also working towards increasing their market share. Their use of aggressive competitive strategies to accomplish this goal creates a competitive business environment, which may threaten the viability of Emirate’s business because airlines will be competing for a limited number of passengers.
</text>
<text>
Environmental factors, which manifest in natural disasters, also threaten the activities of airlines in the industry because they could cause disruptions in air travel operations. These environmental effects may also be felt by the airline through an increase in operational expenses, as would be evident if the price of fuel increase because of global warming or climate change (Oregon State University, 2020). This effect could also be seen through a slump in the global economic environment, which would lead to a depressed demand for air travel. This effect is captured in table 2 above, as is the case with the policy changes and bans on travel imposed on passengers from selected countries because of political factors influencing travel decisions. For example, the travel bans imposed on certain Islamic countries by the US government impedes the frequency of travel between countries. The effects of such actions could best be compared to the effects that terrorism has had on global travel in the past decade. It led to increased scrutiny at airports and a heightened level of safety surveillance among travellers, especially from Middle Eastern countries (Corder, 2019). Collectively, these forces have negatively influenced the global airline travel market. They are likely to continue to affect the industry through the proliferation of current protectionist policies adopted by selected governments. Collectively, a cumulative score of 2.40 for external factors affecting the airline industry means that the above-mentioned factors have a significant impact on airline operations.
Internal Environment Analysis
SWOT Analysis
In this document, Emirate’s response to its competitive environment, relative to its internal capabilities, is going to be assessed using the SWOT analysis technique, which focuses on a company’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Table 3 below highlights the SWOT analysis findings for Emirates Airline.

The findings highlighted above mean that Emirate Airline needs to address its key area of vulnerability, which is its overdependence on government support to sustain its business and amplify its main strength which its vast travel network. The latter approach is especially important to the company’s overall sustainability plan because customers have traditionally flown with the airline due to its affordable ticket costs in frequently travelled routes. In this regard, few rivals have been able to effectively compete with Emirates in terms of its market appeal, mostly because the airline enjoys immense support from the government and people of the UAE.
</text>
<text>
One of the main issues emerging from this case study is the need to develop new marketing strategies that would increase the company’s market share beyond Middle East. This problem involves maintaining the airline’s dominant position in the gulf region as well, while taking advantage of the immense market opportunities that are emerging in new territories. Particularly, there is a need to develop effective marketing strategies that would appeal to changing consumer preferences in travel. This strategy is occasioned by the increasing influence of millennials in the air travel industry (McLeod and Croes, 2018). In this analysis, Emirates needs to realize that its traditional market segmentation strategy that is based on income differentiations should be updated to one that reflects the traveller’s tastes and attitudes. This shift in strategic direction needs a wider cultural shift in the organisation’s practices from one that relies a lot on managerial direction to another that allows room for innovation from a bottom-up perspective (McLeod and Croes, 2018). Indeed, it is only through the lessons learned through the failures of experimentation that the airline can effectively adapt to changes in the industry.
Another emerging issue is the lack of strategic preparedness for Emirate Airlines to exploit new market opportunities that have emerged from economic developments in overseas markets. Particularly, the company has not come up with practical actions steps to exploit new market opportunities in countries that have a growing middle class population that is eager to travel. Therefore, Emirates remains strategically ill-equipped to take advantage of the new market opportunities posed by changing political, social and economic forces impacting its external and internal environment.

In this report, an evaluation of the required strategies for Emirate to adopt as it embarks on sustaining its next level of growth will be undertaken through a review of the outcomes of three strategic evaluation frameworks: Strategic Position and Action Evaluation (SPACE) matrix, Boston Consulting Group (BCG) matrix and grand strategy matrix. These evaluation frameworks will be used to provide the right context for the introduction and implementation of new recommendations that would address the emerging issues highlighted above. The models would also be used as a basis for formulating a raft of recommendations that would be outlined in the recommendations section of this report.

The SPACE matrix is often used to evaluate the strategic choices of a company, relative to its prevailing internal and external environmental analyses. The structure of the matrix assumes that an organisation should either adopt a conservative, aggressive, defensive, or competitive strategy, relative to its environmental influences (Panigrahy, Kumar and Singh, 2017). Each of these strategic choices is represented by a quadrant that outlines the specific conditions that warrant the application of one strategic direction. Based on the findings of Emirate’s internal and external environmental factors, the airline should pursue an aggressive international strategy because it has a strong competitive position in the gulf region as Middle East’s most dominant airline. Therefore, it needs to use its internal strengths to sustain its growth and implement an aggressive market penetration strategy to exploit market opportunities that are emerging in new territories. This strategy may involve the development of new products, integrating company functional areas with those of its partners and the pursuit of beneficial merger and acquisition strategies with like-minded airlines.
</text>
<text>
These recommendations have been developed after considering the effects of the company’s internal and external strategic dimensions. The goal is to determine Emirate’s strategic posture in the industry, relative to its competitors. The internal strategic dimensions have been borrowed from the SWOT findings and amalgamated in this analysis to highlight two key strategic decision-making areas – financial strength and competitive advantage. As highlighted in the internal and environmental analyses highlighted in this report, Emirate’s key competencies are traceable to the company’s financial strength, which stems from its parent company – the Emirates Group. The entity is guaranteed by the state and provides an endless supply of resources to the airline to stay operational even in the wake of global uncertainties on travel. Its competitive edge stems from its value leadership brand in the Middle East region and the positive reputation it has built in the industry over the years. Nonetheless, the external strategic dimensions of Emirates Airline have been evaluated based on the considerations of the company’s vulnerability to environmental forces and its relative industry strength.
Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Matrix
The BCG matrix classifies a company’s strategic position into four groups “question mark” “starts” “poor dogs” and “cash cows.” The classification system is based on the level of industry attractiveness and a company’s competitive position (Pruschkowski, 2018).
</text>
<text>
Emirates should pursue a “cash cow” strategy because the airline already enjoys a positive brand image in the industry. Therefore, it would be leveraging this capability to “milk” as much cash as possible from the market. This type of strategy is linked to companies, which have a positive brand image and have gained their customers’ trust (Pruschkowski, 2018). Emirates Airline fits this profile because its strategic fit is contextualized within the dominant market position it enjoys in the industry. Relative to this analysis, Pruschkowski (2018) argues that the money generated from the implementation of such a strategy should be invested in the “stars” portfolio of the BCG matrix for long-term dividends. Overall, the “cash cow” portfolio of the BCG matrix represents Emirate’s strategic position in the airline sector because the decisions made in this stage of the company’s growth are not supposed to induce growth but rather support the existing one (Pruschkowski, 2018). This is Emirate’s current situation because it already enjoys a strong growth momentum in the market that few other airlines in the Middle East enjoy (Stephens et al. , 2017). Therefore, its strategic focus should be on extending its market dominance position.
Grand Strategy Matrix
According to table 5 below, Emirate’s grand strategy lies in the first quadrant of the grand strategy matrix because of its strong market position. It has also reported a strong rate of growth that outpaces its rivals in the industry (Stephens et al. , 2017). Therefore, its grand strategy needs to exploit these attributes.

The strategic evaluation process for Emirates Airline was undertaken through a careful review of the external and internal forces acting on it. The external analysis was performed using the PESTLE analysis tool, external factor evaluation matrix and competitive profile matrix. Comparatively, the internal factor analysis was completed using the internal factor evaluation matrix and the SWOT analysis tool. Based on the use of these strategic assessment methods, the biggest external factors affecting Emirates that emerged from the analysis is changing consumer tastes and preferences and growing uncertainties in the global economic environment. A review of the company’s internal factors suggest that Emirates Airline also has a strong brand image and enjoys massive political and economic support from the UAE government and its people. Based on these analyses, the biggest issue that has emerged from this review is the need to sustain the company’s growth by appealing to the millennial population, which is expected to spur the next phase of airline growth. On this basis, the proposed long-term objectives of the airline are as follows:
</text>
<text>
To achieve the above-mentioned goals, it is pertinent for Emirates Airlines to initiate a cultural shift in the company’s marketing plan and make it more receptive to innovation and new product developments. In other words, the company should no longer be focused on developing new products based on class as the main criterion of market differentiation. Instead, the overall marketing culture should be changed to address unique generational tastes and preferences in travel, as the new frontier for aviation innovation. The company will be a leader in this area of management focus because no other airline has adopted this approach. Changing the company’s overall corporate culture may involve rethinking its training curriculum to make staff more aware of the needs of younger travellers and redesigning the company’s overall pricing strategy to make it more affordable for the new demographic of travellers. The new approach to learning may require some employees to be retrained about new customer service practices, while new recruits could directly be recruited based on the new criteria of employment identified above. Emirates also needs to allocate more resources to the company’s research and development team to enable it to develop new products that appeal to the needs of millennials. This strategic management approach may involve the company’s top leadership and possibly the Emirates Group Chief Executive Officer since he is responsible for making critical resource allocation decisions.

Due to technological progress and the re-shaping of moral values in modern society, health care becomes a complex field, with the necessity to change and make decisions regularly. In DNP projects, nursing scholars have to develop their strategic planning and thinking skills to solve complex issues and understand how to involve in this work (Falk et al., 2015). To be more involved in strategic management decisions, a scholar has to investigate internal and external aspects of a project. It is possible to learn the population or the community where an intervention has to be implemented. Strategic initiatives may be improved if clear goals and missions are defined and discussed within a team. It does not matter if a DNP practice scholar works alone or in a team, the creation of specific mission-driven contexts cannot be ignored (Falk et al., 2015). As soon as enough questions are posed, and certain answers are given, a DNP project will be strategically enhanced.

In any research project, the establishment of a team turns out to be an integral step. Despite the intentions to create the most favored working environment, some nurses feel unvalued or misunderstood, which considerably influences a culture of teamwork. Strategic planning involves teambuilding, as well as the recognition of task forces (Falk et al., 2015). To support nursing practice and project plans, several strategies can be effective. First, an open-door policy will provoke regular communication and the possibility to discuss urgent issues. Second, the combination of leadership and team autonomy will improve the outcomes without breaking a rule that any team should have a leader and develop democratic relationships. Finally, problem-solving contributes to teambuilding experiences because researchers must be mutually developed instead of being oriented toward one particular task.
</text>
<text>
As well as any work, nursing practice is characterized by properly applied quality and safety initiatives to support its outcomes. Strategic planning in a DNP project includes the development of political and financial decisions to promote quality and safety (Falk et al., 2015). Such initiatives will help to reduce the number of negative outcomes and problems within a community. Medical errors could happen even if the most definite steps are taken, and quality and safety improvement should stay sustainable in nursing practice. The analysis of past achievements and recent expectations will show how the offered idea changes the current state of affairs. An understanding of patients’ needs and nurses’ opportunities will help to develop a plan, using available resources and knowledge. In this DNP project, a quality and safety initiative aims at improving the quality of care and reducing maternal hemorrhage, and it is expected to analyze the impact of the offered intervention through the comparison complications’ statistics.
Conclusion
In general, the combination of strategic management decisions and teambuilding strategies promotes a good possibility to achieve positive outcomes in DNP practice. An understanding of goals and missions, cooperation with people, and recognition of quality standards are the crucial steps in this research project. To support this work, it is necessary to ask correct questions, respect each other, and think about the potential impact of the already-made decisions.

The authors of the paper raise topics related to improper payments regularly occurring in various companies. They argue that “the risk of improper payments increases in programs with complex criteria for computing payments, a significant volume of transactions, or emphasis on expediting payments” ( Strategies to manage improper payments , 2001, p. 8). The authors’ main point is that work on these problems must be first carried out within the company. Only in this way, will organizations be able to establish work processes and be ready to communicate with other stakeholders. This will help them avoid losses and keep track of all internal operations.

The authors give an example of such a system in the U.K. Their government was committed to ensuring that all payments were timely, calculated, consistent with the circumstances, and controlled. Thanks to this, the country managed to reduce the monetary losses from fraud significantly. Without strategic planning, this would hardly have been achieved. If an organization does not control internal processes, it cannot rely on accuracy in calculations. In addition, the lack of control allows external forces to affect these processes adversely. That is why strategic planning is necessary for the productive work of organizations.

Despite this, in some situations, companies may sometimes be not as attentive to strategic planning. For instance, during a crisis, most organizations should focus on the current state of things. It is vital to understand what areas of work should be paid special attention to for the company to keep functioning. It is also worth applying measures that alleviate the crisis of the organization. Moreover, all these actions will not necessarily lead to positive results in the long run. However, they are essential because the survival of the company depends on this. Therefore, in these situations, strategic planning fades into the background.

The U.K. Parliament has set standards to support its plan and achieve the best results. In particular, “it enacted legislation authorizing data sharing activities within and between government agencies and departments” ( Strategies to manage improper payments , 2001, p. 16). This has made financial information more open and accessible, so they can better track inaccuracies. In addition, the state has begun to promote anti-fraud policies actively. In this way, they aroused interest in the problem among the public, which allowed attracting even more attention to it. Thus, the entire state was able to track and evaluate the success of the fight against fraud.
</text>
<text>
The U.K. Parliament has taken significant steps to improve the financial situation. Since the problem exists on the scale of the whole state, competent and accurate strategic planning was necessary. In my opinion, the parliament managed to work out an effective system of measures to combat fraud. This planning had a positive impact on the country’s economic situation and made citizens more conscious of financial issues. The economic situation of the whole country has improved; therefore, the standard of living of its inhabitants has become higher. Although it is challenging to get rid of fraud completely, the state’s strategy is aimed at this and keeps moving in this direction.
Strategic planning is a crucial part of the public sector. Government organizations, as a rule, are focused on long-term existence. Therefore, they need to plan further actions and anticipate future opportunities and challenges. This will allow them to be more flexible and adapt to any possible situations. In addition, they exist within an extensive, connected state system. In strategic planning, it is necessary to focus on it to be protected by the state and not lag behind. Thus, strategic planning is one of the most critical areas of the activity of various organizations.

Strategies for Competitive Advantage Essay (Article)
</text>
<text>
Establishing a competitive advantage is one of the primary goals of any company. In today’s highly competitive environment, businesses without such a benefit find it very hard to increase the profitability ratio or even survive. Large retailer chains, such as Target or Walmart, give their customers the possibility to order online and pick up at a nearby store. However, such an option has not been applied by any smaller discount chains until recently. Currently, Dollar General allows its customers to total up items they wish to buy in-store through the app. Dollar General Corp. decided to broaden its digital strategy, offering its customers “the buy-online, pick-up-in-store feature” (Castellanos, 2019, para. 6). It is projected that the new initiative will attract a younger stratum of customers.
Cost leadership, Differentiation, and Focus are the business competitive advantage strategies Dollar General Corp. utilizes to stand out from the extreme competition. Some of these tactics can be applied even to smaller-scale businesses, such as a family convenience store in a neighborhood. A company or a business must be able to establish the benefit it wishes to provide to the target audience that would differentiate it from the competitors to develop a competitive advantage.
Cost Leadership
Cost Leadership strategy allows a company to offer its customers products at a lower price. Dollar General already applies this method successfully; however, it doesn’t distinguish it from its competitors such as Dollar Tree or Five Below. Besides, this tactic is unlikely to be used by a smaller business (for example, a family-owned convenience store Giordano’s) since its buying power is much lower than that of a chain grocery store. Hence, suppliers are unlikely to offer it a more attractive acquisition price.
</text>
<text>
Dollar General’s example shows that only offering low-cost products is not enough to outperform competitors since they apply the same strategy. However, digitalizing the purchasing process allows it to stand out since this benefit offers “real value” which is time-saving and convenient (Amadeo, 2019, para. 3). The strategy of differentiation is the one that can be successfully applied to Giordano’s mentioned earlier. This store already has a small webpage that allows buyers to see the available products and prices. Enhancing the webpage features outlined above would increase the store’s profitability in the future, given no other stores in the neighborhood offer this option. Lee and Yoo (2019) refer to it as “seizing capability – an ability to seize sensed opportunities” (p. 5). According to the research, “a company with a strong seizing capability can select the most suitable opportunity at the right moment and create innovative results” (Lee and Yoo, 2019, p. 5). In this sense, concentrating on service differentiation by expanding online ordering options for customers as Dollar General does, Giordano’s can distinguish itself from other local convenience stores.

Another strategy used by Dollar General is focus, which is concentrating on a specific target group. By enhancing its online purchasing options, Dollar General targets a younger group of buyers who are “digitally savvy and all about convenience” (Castellanos, 2019, para. 15). Miller (2020) justly notes that “without recurring sales, a business slowly dies” (para. 12). In analogy with Dollar General, it would be reasonable for Giordano’s to target the younger stratum of people in the neighborhood by offering the order pick-up option since it already has the advantage of being geographically closer than other larger grocery stores.

Facing today’s intense competition, businesses, big and small alike, must strive to construct a competitive advantage that would allow them to surpass fellow market players. Even though such strategies as Cost Leadership maybe not be applicable to small businesses, they can differentiate themselves from competitors by using other channels, such as technological innovations, targeting a specific group of customers, or using a unique geographical location. By applying such strategies, a small business may offer its target customer group certain benefits or service options that no other competitor can.

It goes without saying that teachers play an immeasurably essential role in students’ lives. They have an opportunity to establish a supportive community that helps classroom management and create a positive atmosphere based on mutual trust, clear expectations, and clear routines (Rapp and Arndt, p. 206). However, teachers frequently face communication challenges determined by cultural, environmental, and personal peculiarities of students and teachers themselves, as well. Specific behavioral patterns common for people from one cultural background may be interpreted incorrectly by the representatives of another culture. For instance, Arabic or Italian students who frequently speak in a loud voice or use gestures in everyday speech may be regarded by a teacher as aggressive or irritated. In turn, the teacher’s communication style may insignificantly affect students’ productivity and concentration in case they are familiar with a different level of discourse. In addition, students may have sensory sensitivities or a different perception of personal space and boundaries that should be considered by all participants of the educational process.

In order to establish appropriate classroom management and create a healthy atmosphere on the basis of mutual trust, respect, and understanding, a teacher should use certain strategies. The modeling of practices that a teacher would like to see and the teaching of character may be regarded as the most essential strategies that help to minimize cultural and individual differences. The modeling of practices implies the building of the students’ characters by a teacher through his or her example (Rapp and Arndt, p. 211). In other words, if a teacher wants students to treat each other with respect and understanding, he or she should primarily respect them. If a teacher listens attentively to a speaking person, deals with minor inconveniencies graciously, and takes responsibilities, students will subsequently adopt the same behavioral patterns in the classroom. The strategy of self-monitoring is closely connected with the modeling of practices and may be applied for the teaching process as well. Students are giving an opportunity to monitor and control their actions and words in order to reduce disruptive behavior and increase positive performance.

Regardless of permanent debates related to the public schools’ role in character education, a specific strategy that focuses on the development of character traits is highly significant for students. Classroom management emphasizes six character traits that “teach the fundamental principles of being a good citizen and student” – respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, trustworthiness, and citizenship (Rapp and Arndt, p. 212). As a matter of fact, each trait is essential for membership in the school community and good citizenship (Rapp and Arndt, p. 212). In general, helping students to develop necessary skills of mutual respect, care, and fairness may be regarded as a highly considerable part of the teaching process.

In addition, it is essential for any competent teacher to create the classroom’s climate that does not tolerate bullying in all forms. Teaching aims to support all students regardless of their gender, ethnicity, physical and mental peculiarities, and socioeconomic status. At the same time, a teacher should understand and find an approach to a bully as a supportive environment implicates caring as well. There are a substantial number of extensive resources dedicated to the reduction of bullying at school that may be helpful for teachers. The purpose of the teaching process is to explain to students that they should be treated equally and accepted with all strengths and weaknesses.

Strategy as Practice: Nature and Perspectives Essay

Strategic management is a complex and creative activity of a company, as well as involved stakeholders, which is aimed at the development of long-term guidelines in the formation of competitive advantages and ways of their implementation in a specific environment. According to Balogun, Jarzabkowski and Seidl (2007), the definition of strategy as practice (SAP) is as follows: “our central research interest focuses on explaining who strategists are, what they do and why and how that is consequential in socially accomplishing strategic activity” (p. 19). This essay will focus on discussing this statement in terms of the pluralistic nature of SAP and its feasibility.

Strategy as practice can be analysed through a 3P framework, including praxis, practices and practitioners. Praxis refers to a strategic activity and its relationships within social, institutional and organisational environments. The concept of practices can be understood as instruments, methods and procedures that are applied during strategizing, while various actors, such as CEOs, directors or consultants are practitioners (Johnson et al., 2016). For example, Apple’s praxis is to provide high-quality gadgets to build strong relationships with customers (practices) through managers, leaders, and CEOs. The literature on SAP integrates various perspectives on the implementation of SAP, providing insights on its roles and impacts. For example, the study by Dahl, Kock and Lundgren-Henriksson (2016) focuses on conceptualising cooperation and underline SAP’s deliberate and dynamic nature. The mentioned authors state that organisational performance can be directly affected by practices, which is one of the key benefits. More to the point, consistent with Porter, Dahl, Kock and Lundgren-Henriksson (2016) conclude that all the individuals involved in SAP play an essential role in its implementation. The interactions between practitioners are of a social nature, which prioritises cooperation and competitiveness.

Another perspective of SAP as a metaphor is provided by Mueller (2018), who examines Goffman’s work in the field of sociology and strategic management. While the fundamentals of SAP were extensively developed by Whittington, Goffman distinguishes between strategy praxis performance, where the credibility and competence of practitioners largely determine the outcomes (Silva & Goncalves, 2016). According to Mueller (2018), “‘organisations’ and ‘positions’ are thing-like in their solidity only because they are continuously and repeatedly enacted in a series of micro-situations” (p. 16). In this connection, the concept of strategising acquires a special role since it requests clarifying how exactly a strategy is performed. This approach is criticised as excessively managerial by Balogun, Jarzabkowski and Seidl (2015), which is expressed in the failure to pay attention to all the elements of SAP simultaneously. Indeed, it seems that Goffman’s perspective is largely concerned with sociological topics, but SAP needs to be considered more comprehensively.

While Porterian approach with its forces signifies economies and external environment, SAP pays attention to a micro-analytical level. Practice is seen as the rationale for action that should be performed by actors, both managers and researchers. In turn, both Simon (1957) and Mason and Mitroff (1981) agree that in terms of SAP, research strategies should focus on the current, everyday activities of practitioners, and the ways in which their actions are related to the final strategic results. This can provide a deeper understanding of what actually happens when people carry out such practices as strategic planning, strategy reviews, strategic workshops, et cetera (Paine & Anderson, 1975). In this case, a company is both an emerging pattern and a set of chosen elements composing its structure, which also reflects the polyvalent nature of SAP.
